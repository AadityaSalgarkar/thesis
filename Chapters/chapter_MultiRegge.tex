\chapter{Conformal multi-Regge theory} 
\label{IntroductionMultiRegge}

% The last decade has seen a lot of progress in the program of conformal bootstrap, an approach to classify conformal field theories (CFTs) by studying their correlation functions \cite{Rattazzi:2008pe}.
% The main idea is to use the general principles of conformal field theories: conformal symmetry, unitarity and crossing symmetry, to constrain the observables \cite{Poland:2018epd}.
% The paradigmatic example is the three-dimensional Ising model for which one can achieve outstanding numerical precision for the spectrum of this theory,
% vastly outperforming the results from Monte-Carlo simulations~\cite{El-Showk:2012cjh,Kos:2016ysd}. Alternatively, one can use the general consistency conditions to constrain the observables analytically.
% The lightcone bootstrap is one such example \cite{Alday:2015ewa,Simmons-Duffin:2016wlq,Komargodski:2012ek}. 
In the previous chapter, we studied the consistency conditions on the correlation function of four scalar operators in a conformal field theory in the Regge limit.
Consistency conditions also impose constraints on dynamical data at the level of more than four point correlation functions.
These correlators give us access to much more data than their lower-point counterparts.
Given that conformal blocks play a central role in conformal bootstrap, their higher-point analogues are studied in \cite{Rosenhaus:2018zqn,Goncalves:2019znr,Buric:2020dyz,Buric:2021kgy,Buric:2021ttm,Buric:2021ywo,Poland:2021xjs}.
Although their structure is generically intricate, it simplifies drastically in the lightcone limit where bootstrap studies have been performed in \cite{Antunes:2021kmm,Bercini:2020msp}.
Higher-point correlation functions have also been considered in holographic theories~\cite{Goncalves:2019znr,Alday:2022lkk,Goncalves:2023oyx}.

An important tool in the analytical conformal bootstrap is the Regge limit \cite{Cornalba:2006xm,Cornalba:2007zb,Costa:2012cb}.
The Regge limit of four-point correlation functions in CFTs is the conformal analogue of the limit of high centre of mass energy  at fixed impact parameter of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory.
The main idea coming out of this study is that the CFT spectrum  admits an elegant description in terms of a set of {\em Regge trajectories}.
In particular, the spectrum admits an intriguing analyticity in spin quantum number, as established by the inversion formula \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}.
This puts the analytical conformal bootstrap using the lightcone limit on a firm footing, by showing that the large spin expansion is not asymptotic, but convergent.
Recently, these ideas have been tested on several physical models, with great success \cite{Simmons-Duffin:2016wlq,Caron-Huot:2022eqs}.
This success calls for a deeper analysis of the Regge limit.
In this chapter we start the discussion of the generalization of the Regge limit to higher-point functions, mostly focusing on the case of five-point functions.

The outline of the chapter is as follows.
In \cref{sec:FlatSpaceScattering}, we review the literature on the multi-Regge limit for the S-matrix.
In \cref{sec:KinematicsFivePointCorrelators}, we discuss the setup of five-point correlation functions in conformal field theories.
We sketch the Euclidean OPE limit and the lightcone limit, and contrast it with our proposal for Regge limit.
In \cref{sec:ReggeTheoryCFT}, we discuss the analytic properties of the correlator and its Mellin transfom.
In subsection \ref{subsec:SWtransform}, we discuss the relation of the Reggeized correlator to the partial wave coefficients.
Finally, we conclude with some open directions \cref{sec:conclusions}. 

% {\bf JVB: I guess the Conclusion is going to be somewhat rewritten. I believe it is important to mention in the introduction what has been done for higher-point functions in CFTs so far.
% %  Do you agree? I can help with that. We should also check the spelling: multi-Regge, multiregge, multi-regge? Also please note if you deal with adjectives or nouns. For example, writing five particle amplitude instead of five-particle amplitude. I correct some of those cases but we should check again.

\section{Scattering in flat-space and Regge theory}
\label{sec:FlatSpaceScattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, we review Regge theory for scattering amplitudes in flat space.
We begin by reviewing the key ingredients in the case of $2 \to 2$ scattering process in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime.
Then, we review the generalization to the case of higher-point scattering amplitudes.
% In this section, we consider the Regge limit of five-point amplitudes in flat space and review the necessary ingredients to discuss Regge theory for them.
It will serve as the main inspiration for the conformal Regge theory that we will consider later.

Let us restrict to the more familiar case of $2 \to 2$ scattering, where we define  the Mandelstam invariants as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mandelstamst}
  s= - ( k_1+k_3)^2\,,\qquad t=-(k_1+k_2)^2\,,\qquad u=-(k_1+k_4)^2,
\end{equation}
with  $k_i$ the external incoming momenta.
The Regge limit corresponds to the high-energy limit of an amplitude, where $s\to \infty$ with fixed $t$.
Regge theory, on the other hand, comes in play to address the experimental observation that $s$-channel
processes exhibit a small $t$ peak whenever there are exchanges of particles or resonances in the $t$-channel.
One would like to understand this behaviour by considering a partial wave decomposition of the amplitude.
Consider the scattering amplitude of four spinless particles with equal mass $m$ in the $t$-channel decomposition 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:4ptpartialwavedef}
  A(s,t)=\sum_{J=0}^{\infty} (2J+1) a_{J}(t) P_{J}(z)\,,
\end{align}
where $z=\cos \theta=1+ 2s/(t-4m^2)$ and
$P_J(z)$ is a Legendre polynomial of first kind of degree $J$. $\theta$ denotes the $t$-channel scattering angle and $J$ is the angular momentum of the exchanged particles.
This series converges in the $t$-channel physical region, namely the region $t>4m^2$ and $s<0$, and therefore is not reliable to study the large $s$ limit.
% {\bf JVB: I think this comment here is not relevant. The comment:}
Note that the large $s$ limit of a spin $J$ partial wave behaves as $ s^{J} $.
The infinite sum over $ J $ gets more and more contributions from the higher $ J $ partial waves, in this limit.
Regge theory provides a rewriting of~(\ref{eq:4ptpartialwavedef}) in a form that can be analytically continued to this large $s$ region.
This is done by complexifying angular momentum, extending Regge's idea~\cite{Regge:1959mz}, and allows to resum the contribution of a family of
particles that correctly predict the observed large s behaviour. 
% {\bf JVB: I changed this sentence to the original text. I believe this as it is now ir more correct than the changed version. We can discuss.}
%which allows us to resum the contribution from all partial waves, to correctly predict the observed large $s$ behaviour.

Naturally, one would like to extend Regge theory to multi-particle exchange amplitudes. The analytic structure of these amplitudes is less well understood than the four-point analogue.
The increasing number of Mandelstam invariants turns this into a more technically-challenging goal, but there have been important contributions in the 70's that we now briefly review
for the case of five-point amplitudes (see \cite{Goddard:1971fq, White:1972sc,White:1972rq,White:1973ola,White:1976qm,Brower:1974yv,Weis:1972tbu,Abarbanel:1972ayr,Stapp:1982mq,PhysRev.176.2003, NotesOnMultiRegge} for more details).

  \caption{The ten two-body Mandelstam invariants of a five-point scattering amplitude (left) and our choice of five independent ones (right).}
  \label{fig:mandelstaminv5pt}
\end{figure}

As represented in figure \ref{fig:mandelstaminv5pt} (left), one can define  ten two-body Mandelstam invariants for a five-point function,
in an analogous way to the $2 \to 2$ scattering definition (\ref{eq:mandelstamst}), i.e.
\begin{equation}
  s_{ij}=-(k_i+k_j)^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $k_i$ are again external incoming momenta. Similarly, we define $t_{ij}$- and $u_{ij}$-type invariants.
Since not all the invariants are independent, we shall choose
the following five as independent, $s_{13},s_{25},s_{45},t_{12},t_{34}$, as shown in figure \ref{fig:mandelstaminv5pt} (right).
We will be focusing on the double Regge limit where $s_{25}, s_{45}\to \infty$, and necessarily $s_{13}\to \infty$, while $t_{12}$ and $t_{34}$ are held fixed.
It is also possible to define a single Regge limit by considering either $s_{25}\to \infty$ with $s_{13}/s_{25}$ also fixed, or $s_{45}\to \infty$ with $s_{13}/s_{45}$ fixed.\footnote{Another interesting limit to consider is the helicity-pole limit where $s_{25}\to \infty$ with $s_{13}/s_{25}\to \infty$ while $t_{12}, t_{34}$ and $s_{45}$ are fixed (or the one where  the roles of $s_{25}$ and $s_{45}$ are swapped). This limit is experimentally accessible in inclusive cross-sections~\cite{PhysRevLett.26.675}. It is also possible to consider the limit $s_{13}\to \infty$ with all the other Mandelstam invariants kept fixed.}
We note that the generalization of the double Regge limit to the case of $n$ identical massive particles is given by
\cite{Brower:1974yv},
% \begin{align}
% 	 & s \text{ type}
% 	 &                & t \text{ type}
% 	 &                & \omega \text{ type (Toller angles)} \nonumber     \\
% 	 & s_{r+1,r+3}^2
% 	 &                & s_{1,r+2}^2
% 	 &                & \frac{s_{p-2,p}^2 s_{p-1,p+1}^2}{s_{p-2,p+1}^2} .
% \end{align}
\begin{align}
 s \text{ type}:                       & \qquad s_{r+1,r+3} \,,                                     \\
 t \text{ type}:                       & \qquad      s_{1,r+2} \,,                                  \\
 \omega \text{ type (Toller angles)} : & \qquad   \frac{s_{p-2,p} s_{p-1,p+1}}{s_{p-2,p+1}} \,,
 \nonumber
\end{align}
where labels are in the following range $    r          =1,\cdots,n-3                                    ,\, p          =4,\cdots,n-1 $.
We also use $ s_{i,j}=-\left( k_{i+1}+\dots+k_j \right)^2 $.
% {\bf JVB: I removed the $n$-point generalizations of Mandelstam invariants as they don't correspond to ours in the 5-point case.}

Let us consider the partial-wave decomposition of an amplitude $ A =  A(s_{25}, s_{45},\eta; t_{12}, t_{34}) $ of five identical massive particles in
the  $t_{12}, t_{34}$ channels,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:partialwavet12t34}
  A
  %  =\sum_{J_1=0}^{\infty}\sum_{J_2=0}^{\infty}\sum_{|m|<J_1, J_2}\left(\prod_{i=1}^{2} (2 J_i+1)\right) a_{J_1,J_2,m}(t_{12},t_{34}) e^{i m \theta_{\text{Toller}}}  d_{0 m}^{J_1}(\cos\theta_1)d_{m 0}^{J_2}(\cos\theta_2)\nonumber \\
  =\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{J_{1,2}=|m|}^{\infty} \prod_{i=1}^{2} (2 J_i+1) a_{J_1,J_2,m}(t_{12},t_{34}) z^{m} d_{0 m}^{J_1}(\cos\theta_1)d_{m 0}^{J_2}(\cos\theta_2)
  \,,
\end{align}
where  $\eta\equiv s_{13}/(s_{25}s_{45})$ and $z\equiv e^{i \theta_{\text{Toller}}}$, as defined below. Here $m$ denotes the allowed helicities of exchanged particles. 
% {\bf Should we use a different letter to avoid confusion with the mass $m$ later?}
We also use Wigner-$d$ functions which can be written in terms of Jacobi polynomials $\mathcal{P}_{J}^{\alpha,\beta}$ as
\begin{align}
  d_{m' m}^{J}(\cos\theta)=\left(\frac{\left(J+m\right)!\left(J-m\right)!}{\left(J+m'\right)!\left(J-m'\right)!}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\sin \frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{m-m'}\left(\cos \frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{m+m'}\mathcal{P}_{J-m}^{m-m',m+m'}(\cos \theta)\,,
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{P}_{J}^{\alpha,\beta}(z)=\sum_ {n=0}^{J} \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \frac{J!}{(J-n)!} \frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(J-n+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(J+\alpha+\beta+2)} z^{n+\alpha} \left(1-z\right)^{J-n+\beta}
  .\end{align}
The scattering angles $\theta_1, \theta_2$ and $\theta_{\text{Toller}}$ have a clear physical meaning - see e.g.~\cite{Brower:1974yv}.
Consider the scattering process shown in the figure~\ref{fig:mandelstaminv5pt} with the exchanged momenta $q_1^2=t_{12}$ and $q_2^2=t_{34}$.
Firstly, we lump together particles $3,4$ and treat them as a single particle of momentum $q_2$.
The angle $\theta_1$ is defined as the scattering angle of the process $12\to 5 (34)$ which happens in a single plane in the center of mass frame.
Secondly, we consider the rest frame of the exchanged momentum $q_2$.
We denote the three momentum of particle-$i$ by $\vec{p}_i$.
As depicted in figure~\ref{fig:anglesframeq2}, we can choose a coordinate system where $\vec{p}_5$ is aligned with the $z$-axis and $\vec{p}_2$ lies somewhere in $xz$-plane.
We define $\theta_2$ as the zenith-angle of $ \vec{p}_3 $, whereas $\theta_{\text{Toller}}$ is the azimuth angle. Alternatively, the Toller angle can   be thought of as the angle
between the two scattering planes corresponding to the $q_1$ and $q_2$ rest frames, respectively.

The scattering angles are related to the Mandelstam invariants in a nontrivial way - see e.g. ~\cite{Weis:1972tbu,White:1973ola},
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:sijtoangles}
    & s_{25}= 2m^2+\frac{1}{2}\left(t_{34}-m^2-t_{12}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{(t_{12}-4m^2)\lambda(t_{12},t_{34},m^2)}{t_{12}}\right)^{1/2} \cos\theta_1\,,          \nonumber                  \\
    & s_{45}= 2m^2+\frac{1}{2}\left(t_{12}-m^2-t_{34}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{(t_{34}-4m^2)\lambda(t_{12},t_{34},m^2)}{t_{34}}\right)^{1/2} \cos\theta_2\,,           \nonumber                 \\
    & s_{13}=2m^2+\frac{1}{4}\left(m^2-t_{12}-t_{34}\right)+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{(t_{12}-4m^2)\lambda(t_{12},t_{34},m^2)}{t_{12}}\right)^{1/2} \cos\theta_1                                         \\
  + & \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{(t_{34}-4m^2)\lambda(t_{12},t_{34},m^2)}{t_{34}}\right)^{1/2} \cos\theta_2+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{(t_{12}-4m^2)(t_{34}-4m^2)}{t_{12} t_{34}}\right)^{1/2}\times\nonumber \\
    & \left(m^2-t_{12}-t_{34}\right)\cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2-\frac{1}{2}\left((t_{12}-4m^2)(t_{34}-4m^2)\right)^{1/2}\sin \theta_1\sin \theta_2 \cos\theta_{\text{Toller}}\,,\nonumber
\end{align}
where we use $\lambda(a,b,c)=a^2+b^2+c^2-2ab-2bc-2ca$. Note that here $m$ corresponds to the mass of the exchanged particles and should not be confused with helicity. We believe the context makes clear which one we refer to.
We emphasize that only $s_{13}$ depends on $\theta_{\text{Toller}}$.
Moreover, in the double Regge limit,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:etaandToller}
  \eta\sim \frac{2(t_{12} t_{34})^{1/2}\cos \theta_{\text{Toller}}+m^2-t_{12}-t_{34}}{\lambda(t_{12},t_{34},m^2)}\,,
\end{align}
independently of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.
This map suffers from some kinematical singularities in terms of the variables $t_{12}, t_{34}$.
These will be extracted from the possible types of singularities that we study below and we focus only on dynamical singularities.

To explore the double Regge region from the partial wave decomposition~(\ref{eq:partialwavet12t34}), we need a well-defined analytic continuation of the amplitude.
In contrast to the $2\to2$ scattering, for multiparticle scattering besides considering complex angular momentum, one also needs to account for helicity  dependence.
As stressed in~\cite{Goddard:1971fq, White:1972rq, White:1972sc, White:1973ola},  the analytic continuation of the amplitude to complex helicity values is also required.
The proper procedure for analytic continuation and its uniqueness deserve some comments.
Let us first review some concepts in the four-point case that will straightforwardly generalize to the five-point case we wish to analyse in more detail.

  \label{fig:cutssplane}
\end{figure}

We assume that a $2\to2$ scattering amplitude has only singularities with dynamical origin. Namely, we only consider poles associated with bound states and branch-cuts starting at physical thresholds for particle production. In figure~\ref{fig:cutssplane} we depict these singularities at fixed $t$ in the complex $s$ plane. We assume that the following dispersion relation at fixed $t$ 
% {\bf I don't know who to cite here, this is standard once one assumes maximal analyticity...}
\begin{align}
  A(s,t) & =\frac{1}{2\pi i} \left(
  \int_{0}^{+\infty} \!\!\! ds' \, \frac{\text{Disc}_{s}(s',t,u')}{s'-s} + \int_{0}^{+\infty} \!\!\! du' \,\frac{\text{Disc}_{u}(s',t,u')}{u'-u} \right) =A_{R}(s,t)+A_{L}(u,t)\,.
\end{align}
Here, we have extended the notion of discontinuities $\text{Disc}_{s}$ and $\text{Disc}_{u}$ to include the contributions of bound-state poles.\footnote{We  assumed that no subtractions were needed in order to neglect contributions from arcs at infinity from the Cauchy integral that gives rise to the dispersion relation. If this is not the case, one should proceed considering instead a subtracted amplitude.}
We have also defined $A_{R}$ and $A_{L}$ with respect to each of the terms.
As it is clear from the definition, each of the terms has only cut contributions along one of the directions in the $s$ complex plane.
This fact is crucial in performing the analytic continuation of the amplitude with good large $J$ behaviour which happens to be unique as guaranteed by Carlson's theorem.
It is also useful to define the {\em signatured amplitude}~\footnote{The reader might be familiar with an equivalent decomposition of the full amplitude in terms of even and odd angular momentum contributions.
These are composed of signatured amplitudes.
Indeed we have $A^{\text{even}}=A^{+}(s,t)+A^{+}(-s,t)$ and $A^{\text{odd}}=A^{-}(s,t)-A^{-}(-s,t)$, where we use $u\sim-s$ in Regge limit.}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:signaturedef}
  A^{\delta}(s,t)=\frac{1}{2}\big(A_{R}(s,t)+\delta\, A_{L}(s,t)\big) ,
\end{align}
where $\delta=\pm 1$.
Note that we replace $u$ by $s$ in $A_{L}$ ensuring that there are only cuts in a single direction.
The full amplitude can be easily reconstructed from the signatured amplitudes as
\begin{align}
  A(s,t)=\sum_{\delta=\pm 1}\left(A^{\delta}(s,t)+\delta\, A^{\delta}(u,t)\right) .
\end{align}
In what follows, we assume that the signatured amplitudes have the same analytic structure as the full amplitude.
%  While this assumption is consistent with the analytic structure of the full amplitude is not the only possibility.
This assumption greatly simplifies the discussion of dynamical singularities of partial-wave amplitudes.
We are entitled to consider the partial wave expansion of the signatured amplitude
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:partialwavesignature}
  A^{\delta}(s,t)=\sum_{J=0}^{\infty} (2J+1) a_{J}^{\delta}(t) P_{J}(z)\,.
\end{align}
Using the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials $P_J$ and (\ref{eq:signaturedef}), we can write
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:partialwavesignatureHelicity}
  a_{J}^{\delta}(t)=\frac{1}{4\pi i}\int_{z_0}^{+\infty} dz'\Big( \text{Disc}_{s}A_{R}(s',t)+\delta\,\text{Disc}_{s}A_{L}(s',t)\Big) Q_J(z')\,,
\end{align}
where $z_0$ is the branch point of the discontinuity and
$Q_J$ is the Legendre polynomial of the second kind  given by
\begin{align}
  Q_J(z) = \int_{-1}^{1} d\zeta \,\frac{P_J(\zeta)}{z-\zeta} \,.
\end{align}

  \label{fig:Jplane4pt}
\end{figure}
Using the symmetry $P_J(z)=(-1)^{J}P_J(-z)$, we perform a Sommerfeld-Watson transform of~(\ref{eq:partialwavesignature})
\begin{align}
  A^{\delta}(s,t)=\int_{C} \frac{dJ}{2\pi i} \frac{\pi}{\sin\pi J} \, (2J+1)a^{\delta}(J,t)P_{J}(-z) \,,
\end{align}
where $C$ is the closed contour depicted in figure~\ref{fig:Jplane4pt}. Due to the good large $J$ behaviour of the partial-wave $P_{J}$, one can continuously deform the contour from $C$ to $C'$, as
shown in the same figure.
We should account for all the possible singularities that   may be encountered during this deformation.
In this chapter, we always assume that these are pole type singularities \footnote{Other type of singularities like Regge cuts and nonsense-wrong-signature-fixed poles also exist. Moreover, singularities can also appear in a multiplicative manner but we neglect this scenario here for simplicity. The interested reader can find a discussion on those in~\cite{Weis:1972tbu} and references thereafter.}
\begin{align}
  a^{\delta}(J,t)\simeq \frac{\beta(t)}{J-\alpha(t)} \,,
\end{align}
where $\alpha(t)$ is a Regge trajectory and $\beta(t)$ is regular in $t$.
Regularity follows from the assumption that $A^{\delta}(s,t)$ has the same analytic structure of the full amplitude $A(s,t)$.
We also use the fact that Steinmann relations~\cite{SteinmannThesis} impose the latter to have no double discontinuity in $s$ and $t$.
At large $s$, we keep the rightmost pole as it gives the leading contribution and write
\begin{align}
  A^{\delta}(s,t)\sim \frac{1}{2\pi i}(-s)^{\alpha(t)} \Gamma\big(-\alpha(t)\big)\beta(t)\,,
\end{align}
where we   absorbed nonsingular factors into the definition of $\beta(t)$.

For the five-particle case  we expect a similar analytic structure of the amplitude in the $s_{25}, s_{45}$ and $s_{13}$ complex planes as in the four-particle case.
We would like to decompose the full amplitude in terms of signatured amplitudes with only right-hand or left-hand cuts for each $s$-type invariant.
We immediately see that we have to consider $2^3=8$ possible signatures.
Indeed, one writes
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:the8signatures}
   & A(s_{ij}, t_{ij})=  \sum_{\delta_{ij}=\pm 1} \left\{
  \left(A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(s_{25},s_{45},\eta, t_{12},t_{34})+\delta_{25} A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}} (-s_{25},s_{45},\eta, t_{12},t_{34}) + \right.\right. \\
   & \left.\left.  \delta_{45} A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}} (s_{25},-s_{45},\eta, t_{12},t_{34}) +
  \delta_{25}\delta_{45} A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}} (-s_{25},-s_{45},\eta, t_{12},t_{34})\right)+ \delta_{13} (\eta\to-\eta)
  \right\}\,,
  \nonumber
\end{align}
where we make a slight abuse of notation by writing $u_{ij}\sim-s_{ij}$ as dictated by the double-Regge limit we are exploring.
Indeed, note that each of the signatured amplitudes $A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}$ is a function with only right-hand cuts in each of the invariants $s_{25},s_{45}$ and $s_{13}$.
While $\delta_{25}, \delta_{45}$ are the already familiar signatures associated with angular momenta in the $t_{12}$ and $t_{34}$ channels,  $\delta_{13}$ is a new signature related to the helicity at the
central vertex.

\end{figure}

Following~\cite{Goddard:1971fq}, we first analyse the analytic continuation of helicity $m$ to complex values.
Inspired by the form of the partial-wave decomposition~(\ref{eq:partialwavet12t34}), one expects the following dispersion relation to hold in the
$z$-complex plane, 
% this is not shown in this figure directly: as shown in figure \ref{fig:tollerContour},
\begin{equation}
  A(s_{ij},\eta, t_{ij})=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{-1-\epsilon}+\int_{-1+\epsilon}^{1-\epsilon}+\int_{1+\epsilon}^{+\infty}\right)\frac{\text{Disc}_{z}A(s_{ij},\eta', t_{ij})}{z'-z}\,dz'\,.
\end{equation}
To have a well-defined analytic continuation, we need to consider amplitudes with cuts either only on the right or only on the left half plane in the respective Mandelstam variable.
Thus, we consider signatured amplitudes as introduced in~(\ref{eq:the8signatures}).
We can write
\begin{align}
  A^{\delta_{13}}(z)=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_m^{\delta_{13}} z^{m}\,,
\end{align}
where we suppress the dependence on labels or parameters that are irrelevant for this discussion.
Using the fact that signatured amplitudes are functions with only right-hand cuts,~\footnote{Note that taking $z\to-z$ is related with $\eta\to -\eta$ as one can see from~(\ref{eq:etaandToller}).} we have
\begin{align}
  a_m^{\delta_{13}}=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^2 \left(\int_{0}^{1-\epsilon}+\int_{1+\epsilon}^{+\infty}\right)\int_{|z|=1}\frac{\text{Disc}_{z}A^{\delta_{13}}(z')}{z'-z} \, z^{-m-1}dz' dz\,.
\end{align}
For $z'>1$ and $m<0$ the $z$-integral gives 0, while for $m\ge0$, it gives $z'^{-m-1}$. On the other hand, if $0<z'<1$ and $m\ge 0$, the residues at the two poles cancel and the integral yields $ 0 $, whereas for $m<0$ we find $-z'^{-m-1}$.
We can then define, as shown in figure \ref{fig:tollerContour},
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:aForsignaturedHelicity}
   & a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}(m)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{1+\epsilon}^{\infty}(z')^{-m-1}\text{Disc}_{z}A^{\delta_{13}}(z') dz'\,, \\
   & a_{<}^{\delta_{13}}(m)=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{0}^{1-\epsilon}(z')^{-m-1}\text{Disc}_{z}A^{\delta_{13}}(z')dz'\,,
\end{align}
where it is clear that $a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}$ has a good asymptotic behaviour in the right half-plane in the complex $m$ variable, whereas $a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}$ does so on the left-half plane.
We can thus perform a Sommerfeld-Watson transform in $m$ and write
\begin{align}
  A^{\delta_{13}}(z) & =\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}(m) z^{m}-\sum_{m=-\infty}^{-1}a_{<}^{\delta_{13}}(m) z^{m}\nonumber                                                               \\
                     & =\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_R}dm\frac{\pi a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}(m)(-z)^m}{\sin \pi m}-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_L}dm\frac{\pi a_{<}^{\delta_{13}}(m)(-z)^m}{\sin \pi m}\nonumber \\
                     & =\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C}dm\frac{\pi \left(a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}(m)+a_{<}^{\delta_{13}}(m)\right)}{\sin \pi m}(-z)^m\,,
\end{align}
where the contours $C_R, C_L$ and $C$ are shown in figure~\ref{fig:ccontoursmplane}. Recovering the previously suppressed dependences and parameters, we have

% Note that while this seems very reasonable, the validity of such analytic continuation is very non-trivial.
This is a reasonable but non-trivial claim.
In fact, ~\cite{White:1972rq,White:1972sc} was only able to check a well-defined analytic continuation for a single angular momentum and helicity, but not the three simultaneously.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no derivation of the latter.
In the following, we assume that this defines a satisfactory analytic continuation of the signatured amplitude in terms of the scattering angles and of $t_{12}$ and $t_{34}$.
However, we would like to rewrite it in terms of the Mandelstam invariants alone.
This can be done by using the map   (\ref{eq:sijtoangles}).
To find the dependence on $s_{25}$ and $s_{45}$, we mimic the analysis of the four-particle case.
On the other hand, the $\eta$ dependence requires one more comment.
We assume that $A^{\delta_{13}}$ is an even function of the Toller angle and, in particular, a function of $\cos\theta_{\text{Toller}}$ (and thus invariant under $z\to 1/z$)\footnote{See~\cite{Weis:1972tbu} for whenever this is not the case.}.
This requirement follows from the realization that $\eta$ is an even function of $\theta_{\text{Toller}}$ and therefore only even functions of $\theta_{\text{Toller}}$ can be rewritten in terms of $\eta$.
This ends up imposing $a_{>}^{\delta_{13}}(m)=a_{<}^{\delta_{13}}(-m)$ and justifies dropping the subscripts when we write
\begin{align}
  A^{\delta_{13}}(\eta)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C}dm\,\frac{\pi a^{\delta_{13}}(m)}{\sin \pi m}(-\eta)^m\,.
\end{align}
Note that, as we write $z$ in terms of $\eta$, we redefine what we mean by $a^{\delta_{13}}$.~\footnote{In particular, as commented before, there are kinematical singularities in the map that we shall ignore when we discuss dynamical singularities in $a^{\delta_{13}}(m)$.}
We can summarize the discussion on analytic continuations of five-particle amplitudes by writing
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:5ptreggeamplitude}
   & A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(s_{25}, s_{45},\eta, t_{12}, t_{34})=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^{3}\int_C dm \left(  \prod_{i=1}^2   \int_{C_i} dJ_i  (2J_i+1)\right) \nonumber                 \\
   & \qquad\qquad \frac{\pi^3 d_{0 m}^{J_1}(-\cos\theta_1)d_{m 0}^{J_2}(-\cos\theta_2)(-\eta)^{m}}{\sin \pi m\sin \pi (J_1-m)\sin \pi(J_2-m)} \,a^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(J_1,J_2, m,t_{12},t_{34}) \nonumber \\
   & \qquad\qquad=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^{3}\int_C dm   \Gamma(-m)    \left(  \prod_{i=1}^2   \int_{C_i} dJ_i  (2J_i+1)\Gamma(-J_i+m) \right)                                                          \\
   & \qquad\qquad (-s_{25})^{J_1-m}(-s_{45})^{J_2-m}(-s_{13})^{m}a^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(J_1,J_2, m,t_{12},t_{34})\,,\nonumber

%\end{align}
where we used $\eta=s_{13}/(s_{25}s_{45})$ and
in the second equality $a^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(J_1,J_2, m,t_{12},t_{34})$ was redefined.

Under the assumption that the analytic continuation of the signatured amplitude has a good asymptotic behaviour in $J_1, J_2$ and $m$ such that we can ignore arcs at infinity, we focus on possible singularities that one might encounter as we move the contours to the left.
In figure~\ref{fig:jandmplanescontours}, we draw both $m$ and $J_i$ complex planes when the respective variable is integrated first.
In particular, we show the possible singularities.
As before, we restrict our analysis to Regge-pole-type of singularities and we refer interested readers to~\cite{Weis:1972tbu,Brower:1974yv} for more details on other type of singularities. 
%One expects that these singularities in $m$ are to the left of contour and that the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitude is completely determined by the dynamical singularities in angular momenta.
%There are two reasons for such an expectation. The
%first reason is tied to the consistency with the Steinmann relations.
%Note that the amplitude has the asymptotic behaviour {JVB: Changed it back to the previous text since the correction does not say what is intended below.}
One expects the singularities in $m$ to the left of contour and that determine the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitude to be completely determined by the dynamical singularities in angular momenta. The reason for that is bi-folded. First, note that the
amplitude has the asymptotic behaviour
\begin{align}
  (-s_{25})^{J_1-m}(-s_{45})^{J_2-m}(-s_{13})^{m}\,.
\end{align}
% For a limit where this is the dominant contribution, as it is the case of double-Regge limit, this expression might generically represent an amplitude which allows for a double discontinuity in two overlapping channel invariants,
Generically, this expression has a nonzero double discontinuity in the partially-overlapping channel invariants, namely $s_{25}$ and $s_{45}$.
However, this is forbidden by Steinmann relations~\cite{SteinmannThesis}.
Therefore, it must be that either $J_1-m$ or $J_2-m$ is a non-negative integer after the capture of poles.
It then follows that, in this limit, helicity singularities are fully determined by angular momentum ones as
\begin{align}
  m=\alpha-N\,,
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is the location of a dynamical singularity in $J_1$ or $J_2$ and $N$ is a non-negative integer.
In the above argument, we naturally assume that the asymptotic behaviour is attained within a physical region for the amplitude.
It is conceivable, however, that such asymptotics do  not correspond to a physical behaviour and thus the argument would require an extension of validity of Steinmann relations for those configurations.
The second reason concerns the special nature of the helicity quantum number.
%    There are other arguments in favour of no dynamical singularities in helicity complex plane determining the asymptotic behaviour.
The physical interpretation of dynamical singularities are associated with the existence of particles.
As helicity is not a good Lorentz invariant and does not classify particles, as mass and spin do, we do not expect dynamical singularities in $m$~\cite{Brower:1974yv, Abarbanel:1972ayr}.
Besides, these assumptions seem to work well with specific models~\cite{Brower:1974yv,Schwarz:1973yz} as we will see below.

We now focus on our particular case of interest, the contribution of two Regge poles $\alpha_1(t)$ and $\alpha_2(t)$ in the double Regge limit with
\begin{align}
  a^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(J_1,J_2, m,t_{12},t_{34})\approx \frac{\beta(m, t_{12},t_{34})}{\big(J_1-\alpha_1(t_{12})\big)\big(J_2-\alpha_2(t_{34})\big)}\,.
\end{align}
In the Regge limit we move the $C_1$ and $C_2$ contours to the left in~(\ref{eq:5ptreggeamplitude}) and capture the poles in complex angular momentum. The leading contributions come from the rightmost poles. We find
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:5ptreggetheory}
   & A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(s_{25}, s_{45},\eta, t_{12}, t_{34}) \sim\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C dm(2 \alpha_1+1)(2 \alpha_2+1)\Gamma(-m) \Gamma(-\alpha_1+m)\Gamma(-\alpha_2+m)\nonumber    \\
   & \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \times(-s_{25})^{\alpha_1-m}(-s_{45})^{\alpha_2-m}(-s_{13})^{m}\beta(m,t_{12},t_{34})\nonumber                                                   \\
   & \sim(-s_{25})^{\alpha_1}(-s_{45})^{\alpha_2} \left((-\eta)^{\alpha_1}\sum_{i}\Gamma(-\alpha_1+i)\Gamma(\alpha_1-\alpha_2-i)\beta(\alpha_1-i,t_{12},t_{34})\frac{\eta^{-i}}{i!}\right. \\
   & \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad
  \left.+(-\eta)^{\alpha_2}\sum_{i}\Gamma(-\alpha_2+i)\Gamma(\alpha_2-\alpha_1-i)\beta(\alpha_2-i,t_{12},t_{34})\frac{\eta^{-i}}{i!}\right).\nonumber
\end{align}
From the first to second line we closed the $C$ contour to the left, capturing all the $\alpha_i$-dependent poles, and absorbed overall constants into $\beta$.
In particular, if we consider the limit $\eta=s_{13}/(s_{25}s_{45})\to \infty$, we can just keep the leading contribution
\begin{align}
  A^{\delta_{25}\delta_{45}\delta_{13}}(s_{25}, s_{45},\eta, t_{12}, t_{34}) & \sim (-s_{13})^{\alpha_1}(-s_{45})^{\alpha_2-\alpha_1}\Gamma(-\alpha_1)\Gamma(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)\beta(\alpha_1,t_{12},t_{34})\nonumber \\
                                                                             & +(-s_{13})^{\alpha_2}(-s_{25})^{\alpha_1-\alpha_2}\Gamma(-\alpha_2)\Gamma(\alpha_2-\alpha_1)\beta(\alpha_2,t_{12},t_{34})\,,
\end{align}
which clearly does  not have double discontinuities in $s_{25}$ and $s_{45}$, as follows from our construction.
Note that the apparent singularities in $\alpha_1=\alpha_2$ are just spurious, as they cancel each other.

There are many subtleties and unproven statements in deriving the Regge theory result~(\ref{eq:5ptreggetheory}), but the final form seems very reasonable in physical terms.
We can analyze these claims in   specific models.
We consider a dual resonance model of a five-particle amplitude in the so-called Bardakci-Ruegg representation~\cite{Bardakci:1969ue}
%(see Appendix A of~\cite{Brower:1974yv} for more details on the following computations),
\begin{align}
  B_5 =  \int \frac{dx_1}{x_1}\, \frac{dx_2}{x_2}\, &
  x_1^{-\alpha(t_{12})} \left( 1-x_1 \right)^{-1-\alpha\left( s_{25} \right)}
  x_2^{-\alpha(t_{34})} \left( 1-x_2 \right)^{-1-\alpha\left( s_{45} \right)}
  \nonumber                                                                                                                                                                        \\
                                                    & \times \left( 1-x_1 x_2 \right)^{-\alpha\left( s_{13} \right) + \alpha\left( s_{25} \right) + \alpha\left( s_{45} \right) },
  \label{eq:BRrepresentation}
\end{align}
where the  integral ranges from $0$ to $1$ in $x_1$ and $x_2$. We defined   $\alpha(x)  = \alpha_0 + x$ with  $\alpha_0$  the intercept of the Regge trajectory.
As stated above, a single Regge limit happens when $ s_{25}$ (or  $s_{45}$),  $s_{13} \rightarrow \infty $ with their ratio fixed. In this limit, it can be shown  \cite{Brower:1974yv} that the region $ x_1 \approx 0 $ dominates in the integral~(\ref{eq:BRrepresentation}).
For the values $ 0<s_{25}/s_{13}<1 $, it can be shown that
\begin{align}
  B_5 =
  \left(
  -s_{13}
  \right)^{\alpha(t_{12})}
  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p_n \left( -\frac{s_{25}}{s_{13}} \right)^{n}
  +
  \left(
  -s_{13}
  \right)^{\alpha(t_{34})}
  \left(
  -s_{25}
  \right)^{\alpha(t_{12})-\alpha(t_{34})}
  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} q_n \left( -\frac{s_{25}}{s_{13}} \right)^{n}
  ,\label{eq:singleReggeBR}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  p_n (t_{12},t_{34}, s_{45}) & =
  \frac{\Gamma\big( n - \alpha(t_{12})\big)\, \Gamma( -n+t_{12}-t_{34})\, \Gamma\big( n - \alpha( s_{45} ) \big)}{\Gamma\big( t_{12}-t_{34}-\alpha( s_{45} ) \big) \, n!}\,,
  \\
  q_n (t_{12},t_{34}, s_{45}) & =
  \frac{\Gamma\big( n - \alpha(t_{34}) \big) \,\Gamma( -n+t_{34}-t_{12})\, \Gamma\big( n +t_{12}-t_{34}- \alpha( s_{45}) \big)}{\Gamma\big( t_{12}-t_{34}-\alpha( s_{45} ) \big) \, n!}\,.
  \label{eq:pqExpressions}
\end{align}
Note that there are no simultaneous singularities in the overlapping Mandelstam invariants.
This follows from the explicit expressions of $ p_n $ and $ q_n $.
The first term has power-law behaviour in $ s_{13} $ and poles in $s_{45} $, while having no singularities in $ s_{25} $.
The second term, on the other hand, has power-law behaviour in both $ s_{25} $ and $ s_{13} $ times a function without any singularities in $s_{45}$.
This is an instance of the Steinmann relations, which hold for the full amplitude.
The double Regge limit corresponds to taking a further limit $ s_{45} \rightarrow \infty $ with the ratio $\eta= s_{13}/\left( s_{25} s_{45} \right) $ fixed.
It leads to \cite{Brower:1974yv}
\begin{align}
  B_5 = \left( -s_{25} \right)^{\alpha(t_{12})} \left( -s_{45} \right)^{\alpha(t_{34})}
  \int_{-i \infty}^{i \infty}  \frac{dm}{2\pi i}  \, \Gamma\big( m- \alpha(t_{12}) \big)\Gamma\big( m- \alpha(t_{34}) \big)
  \Gamma (-m) \left( -\eta\right)^{m}\,,
  \label{eq:doubleReggeBR}
\end{align}
which is of the same form as~(\ref{eq:5ptreggetheory}).

With the knowledge of the multi-Regge limit in S matrix theory, we are now in a position to study the multi-Regge limit in conformal field theories.

%The generalization to higher point scattering amplitudes involves the following Mandelstam invariants \cite{Brower:1974yv,Bartels:2012gq,Caron-Huot:2020vlo}:
%\begin{align}
%	 & s \text{ type}
%	 &                & t \text{ type}
%	 &                & \omega \text{ type (Toller angles)} \nonumber     \\

%	 &                & \frac{W_{p-2,p}^2 W_{p-1,p+1}^2}{W_{p-2,p+1}^2} .
%\end{align}
%where $ W_{i,j}^2  = \left( k_{i+1}+\cdots + k_{j} \right)^2     $ is defined in terms of the external momenta, and labels are in the following range $    r          =1,\cdots,n-3                                    ,\, p          =4,\cdots,n-1 $.
%In words, $ s $ type invariants correspond to two body momenta just as in the case of four point scattering amplitude.
%However, $ t $ type invariants use $ r+1 $ momenta.
%For instance, $ W_{1,r+2}^{2}  = \left( k_{2} + \cdots + k_{r+2} \right)^{2}$.
%Unlike the case of two to two scattering, $ s $ and $ t $ are not on the same footing and therefore do not map to each other under crossing.
%
%% In $ d=4 $, this amounts to $ 3n-10 $ variables for $ n $-point scattering amplitude.
%% In $ d $-dimensional quantum field theories, the number of independent variables are $ n\left( n-1 \right)/3 $ when $ n<d+1 $, and otherwise $ \left( d-1 \right)n-d\left( d+1 \right)/2 $.
%For instance, for five point scattering amplitudes, the $ s $-type and $ t $-type invariants are as follows in terms of the external particles mass $ m $ :
%\begin{align}
%	s\text{-type} \,  &  & \left( k_3+k_4 \right)^2,\,  & \left( k_4+k_5 \right)^2       \\
%	t\text{-type}  \, &  & \left( k_2+k_3 \right)^2 ,\, & \left(k_2+ k_3+k_4 \right)^2 .
%\end{align}
%Apart from these, there is a specific ratio
%\begin{align}
%	\omega & =\frac{ \left(k_3+k_4\right)^2 \left(k_4+k_5\right)^2 }{\left( k_3+k_4+k_5 \right)^2}
%	.
%\end{align}
%that is kept fixed, even when both the numerators and the denominators approach $ \infty $.
%In this notation, the multi-Regge limit corresponds again to sending $ s$-type variable to $\infty $ while keeping other type of variables fixed.
%% Note that, while the $ s,t $  generalize the Mandelstam invariants for 4 point scattering, some properties related to crossing do not generalize.
%% In particular, $ 4! $ permutations of the external points permute $ s,t,u $  among themselves, in the 2 to 2 scattering.
%% However, the analogous $ 5! $  permutations do not permute $ s_r $  and $ t_r $  variables.
%% Therefore, we consider the Mandelstam invariants formed by product of two momenta $ k_i\cdot k_j$.
%
%
%In this section, we discuss the Regge limit and its generalization to multi-Regge limit in the specific case of string theory.
%We will consider the Regge limit of the string theory amplitude.
%First, we will consider the full amplitude using worldsheet methods.
%Then, we will use a particular limit of the Mandelstam invariants to arrive at the Regge limit of the amplitude from the partial wave analysis.
%% Second, we will use the coupling constants and masses on the leading Regge trajectory to directly find the Regge limit amplitude.  Third, we will use a particular generalization of OPE limit on the worldsheet to arrive at the same answer.

%For concreteness, we review the case of four particle scattering amplitude in detail.

%Here, the Mandelstam variables are constrained by $ s+t+u=-1$ in the units where $ \alpha' = 1 $.
%One can compute the Regge limit of this amplitude by sending $ s$ to infinity while keeping $t  $ fixed, by using the Stirling formula.
%
%Another way to understand this amplitude is to consider a particular channel and perform the partial wave expansion in terms of the harmonic polynomials of the scattering angle $ z= \cos\left( \theta \right) = 1+ 2s/\left( t+4 \right)$.

%The spectrum of the particle with mass $ M $ and spin $ J $ is encoded in the analytic structure of $ a_J\left( t \right) $, where the mass $ M  $ appears as a pole.

%Note that the residue is a polynomial of degree $ 2n  $ in $ s $.
%These residues can be computed for a given $ z $ in terms of the partial wave expansion as follows,
%\begin{align}
%	\text{Res}_{t=2n} T\left( s,t \right) & =\displaystyle\sum_{J=0}^{\infty}P_J\left( z \right) \text{Res}_{t=2n} a_J\left( t \right)
%	=
%	-\frac{2\left( n+2 \right)^{2n}}{\left( 2n  \right)!}
%	z^{2n}
%	+ O\left( z ^ {2n-2} \right)
%	.
%	\nonumber
%\end{align}
%This implies that $ a_J\left( t \right) $ has poles at $ t=2n$ with $ n=J/2,J/2+1,\cdots $.
%The leading pole is given by
%\begin{align}
%	a_J\left( t \right) & \approx \frac{r\left( J \right)}{t-M ^ {2} \left( J \right)  }
%	, \,                &
%	\text{where }
%	M ^ {2}\left( J \right)  = J,                                                            r\left( J \right) = -\frac{2\left( 2J+2 \right)^{J}}{J!}
%	.
%\end{align}
%The information about only the leading pole is \textit{sufficient} to determine the Regge behavior of the full amplitude, since $ z \rightarrow \infty $ in the Regge limit.
%% \textbf{To be continued}
%
%% \Cref{eq:veneziano} is derived using the worldsheet analysis in string theory.
%% We would like to utilize it to directly arrive at the Regge limit $ s \rightarrow \infty $ with $ t $ fixed, \textit{without} calculating the full amplitude.
%% This exercise will be useful especially for the higher point case where the full amplitude is not known in terms of known mathematical functions.
%% Schematically, the integral representation for  (\ref{eq:veneziano}) is
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T\left( k_{i,j} \right) & = \int d^2 z |z|^{\alpha k_{3,1}} |1-z|^{\alpha k_{2,1}}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% Here, $ k_{i,j} $ are defined as the product of the momenta $ k_i \cdot k_j $.
%% This involves saddle point analysis of the integral above.
%% If both the exponents are large, it is easy to show that the integral localizes at $ z=  k_{1,3}/(k_{1,3}+ k_{2,1}) $.
%% However, we are interested in a limit when $ k_{1,2} \rightarrow \infty $ with $ k_{1,3} $ fixed.
%% $ z \rightarrow 0 $ corresponds to such a limit.
%% Naively, this gets the contribution from one of the particles in the theory, which is the leading pole in $ k_{1,2} $ \cite{Brower:2006ea}.
%% However, we expect the whole leading Regge trajectory to contribute in the Regge limit.
%% It can be achieved by taking the limit $ z\rightarrow   0 $ with the product $ z \cdot k_{1,2} $ fixed.
%% This allows us to compute the Regge form, denoted by $T\left( s,t \right)^\mathcal{R}  $, of the amplitude directly to be \cite{Brower:2006ea,Costa:2012cb}
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T\left( s,t \right)^\mathcal{R} \approx \frac{\Gamma\left( {-\alpha' t/4} \right)}{\Gamma\left( {1+\alpha' t/4} \right)}\left( \frac{\alpha's}{4} \right) ^{2+\frac{\alpha' t}{4}}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% The pole structure in the variable $ t $ is explicit in the $ \Gamma $ functions.
%
%% First, we consider the Veneziano formula for open string theory as a toy model of higher point analysis.
%% \begin{align}
%% 	A\left( s,t \right) & = \frac{\Gamma\left( -s \right) \Gamma\left( -t \right)}{\Gamma\left( -s-t \right)}
%% .
%% \end{align}
%
%% TODO: partial wave expansion.
%
%For the five point function, we discuss the generalization of this calculation\cite{Brower:1974yv}.
%Consider the following amplitude from open string theory called Bardakci-Ruegg representation
%\begin{align}
%	B_5 = \int
%	x_1^{-1-\alpha_1} \left( 1-x_1 \right)^{-1-\alpha\left( s_1 \right)}
%	x_2^{-1-\alpha_2} \left( 1-x_2 \right)^{-1-\alpha\left( s_2 \right)}
%	\left( 1-x_1 x_2 \right)^{-\alpha\left( s_{12} \right) + \alpha\left( s_1 \right) + \alpha\left( s_2 \right) }
%	.\label{eq:BRrepresentation}
%\end{align}
%Here, we use $ \alpha_i = \alpha_0 + t_i, \alpha\left( s \right)  = s+ \alpha_0 $, and the integral ranges from $0$ to $1$ in $x_1$ and $x_2$.
%This integral representation can be used to find the various limits of the amplitude $ B $, similar to the four point case.
%In the channel we are considering, the Mandelstam invariants suitable for Regge limit are as follows:
%\begin{align}
%	s_1 =k_2\cdot k_5 ,\,
%	s_2 =k_5\cdot k_4 ,\,
%	s_{12} =k_1\cdot k_3,\,
%	t_1=k_1\cdot k_2 ,\,
%	t_2 =k_3\cdot k_4
%	.\label{eq:mandInvs}
%\end{align}
%Simplest generalization of the Regge limit is single Regge limit, where $ s_1,s_{12} \rightarrow \infty $ with their ratio fixed.
%In this limit, it can be shown  \cite{Brower:1974yv} that the region $ x_1 \approx 0 $ dominates in the integral \cref{eq:BRrepresentation}.
%For the values $ 0<s_1/s_{12}<1 $, it can be shown that
%\begin{align}
%	B_5 =
%	\left(
%	-s_{12}
%	\right)^{\alpha_1}
%	\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p_n \left( -\frac{s_1}{s_{12}} \right)^{n}
%	+
%	\left(
%	-s_{12}
%	\right)^{\alpha_2}
%	\left(
%	-s_{1}
%	\right)^{\alpha_1-\alpha_2}
%	\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} q_n \left( -\frac{s_1}{s_{12}} \right)^{n}
%	,\label{eq:singleReggeBR}
%\end{align}
%where,
%\begin{align}
%	p_n & =
%	\frac{\Gamma\left( n - \alpha_1 \right) \Gamma\left( -n+\alpha_1-\alpha_2 \right) \Gamma\left( n - \alpha\left( s_2 \right) \right)}{\Gamma\left( \alpha_1-\alpha_2-\alpha\left( s_2 \right) \right) \, n!},
%	\\
%	q_n & =
%	\frac{\Gamma\left( n - \alpha_2 \right) \Gamma\left( -n-\alpha_1+\alpha_2 \right) \Gamma\left( n -\alpha_2+\alpha_1- \alpha\left( s_2 \right) \right)}{\Gamma\left( \alpha_1-\alpha_2-\alpha\left( s_2 \right) \right) \, n!}
%	.\label{eq:pqExpressions}
%\end{align}
%
%Note that there are no simultaneous singularities in the overlapping Mandelstam invariants.
%This follows from the explicit expressions of $ p_n $ and $ q_n $.
%The first term has power law behavior in $ s_{12} $ and poles in $ s_2 $, while having no singularities in $ s_1 $.
%The second term has power law behavior in both $ s_1 $ and $ s_{12} $ times a function without any singularities in $ \alpha\left( s_2 \right) $.
%This is an instance of a much more general phenomenon, called `Steinmann relations', which hold for the full amplitude.
%We comment on it in \cref{app:steinmann}.
%
%Double Regge limit corresponds to taking a further limit $ s_2 \rightarrow \infty $ with the ratio $\omega= s_{12}/\left( s_1 s_2 \right) $ fixed.
%It leads to \cite{Brower:1974yv}
%\begin{align}
%	B_5 = \left( -s_1 \right)^{\alpha_1} \left( -s_2 \right)^{\alpha_2} \frac{1}{2\pi i}
%	\int_{-i \infty}^{i \infty}  d\lambda  \, \Gamma\left( \lambda- \alpha_1 \right)\Gamma\left( \lambda- \alpha_2 \right)
%	\Gamma\left( -\lambda \right) \left( -\omega\right)^{\lambda}
%	.\label{eq:doubleReggeBR}
%\end{align}
%
%This gives us the multi Regge form of the amplitude.
%Again, this integral can be computed by picking the poles in the first two Gamma functions, and closing the contour to the left.
%This also gives rise to a limiting amplitude that is consistent with Steinmann relations, as there are no triple power law singularities in $ s_1,s_2,s_{12} $.
%
%It would be interesting to reproduce this answer from Sommerfeld-Watson transform.
%One would need to find the partial wave coefficients in a closed form and analytically continue them in the respective quantum numbers.
%This is a non-trivial task, and we leave it for future work.
%
%
%Now, we provide a brief review of the S matrix Regge theory, without referring to any specific model such as string theory.
%The main goal is to describe the appropriate procedure to perform Sommerfeld-Watson transform.
%We review the various signatures involved in the Froissart-Gribov continuations of five point scattering amplitude in four dimensional quantum field theories, closely following \cite{Goddard:1971fq}.
%See also, \cite{White:1972sc,White:1973ola}.
%The reader familiar with the content may safely move to the next section.
%
%For the four particle case, we expand the amplitude, a function of Mandelstam invariants, in terms of the partial waves in one channel.
%\begin{align}
%	A\left( s,t \right) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} a_j\left( t \right) C_j\left( \cos \theta \right)
%	,\label{eq:4ptPartialWave}
%\end{align}
%where $ \cos \theta $ denotes the scattering angle in that channel.
%This admits Froissart-Gribov (FG) continuation in $ j $, for even and odd $ j $, separately.
%
%We discuss its generalization to five point amplitude, $ A\left( s_{12},s_1,s_2,t_1,t_2 \right) $.
%Here, $ s_{12},s_1,s_2 $ and $ t_1,t_2 $ (not written in the following equations for brevity) are the natural generalizations of $ s,t $, respectively, to five point functions \cite{Goddard:1971fq}.
%Let's denote the particle interacting with $ 1,2 $ be $ 6 $, as well as $ 3,4 $ be $ 7 $.
%Note that, the momentum conservation imposes constraints on the momenta of $ 6 $ and $ 7 $.
%We would like to define the scattering angles in the rest frame of $ 6 $ and $ 7 $.
%Let $ \zeta_1,\zeta_2 $ denotes these scattering angles.
%An important role is played by an invariant $ z = e^{i \theta_{\mathtt{Toller}}}  $, called Toller invariant.
%% ADD DISCUSSION OF THE FRAME AND INVARIANTS.
%Geometrically, $ \theta_{\mathtt{Toller}} $ denotes the angle between two scattering planes, one with $ 1,2 $ ingoing and another with $ 3,4 $ ingoing.
%
%Similar to \cref{eq:4ptPartialWave}, the five point amplitude can be expanded in partial waves.
%The coefficients of this expansion are labeled by the corresponding quantum numbers as $ a^{j_1,j_2}_{m} $
%The partial wave expansion is
%\begin{align}
%	A\left( \zeta_1,\zeta_2,z \right) = \sum_{j_1=0}^{\infty}  \sum_{j_2=0}^{\infty} \sum_{\left|m\right| <j_1,j_2} a_{m}^{j_1,j_2} z^m P_{j_1}^{-\left|m\right| }\left( \zeta_1 \right)P_{j_2}^{-\left|m\right| }\left( \zeta_2 \right)
%	.\label{eq:5ptPartialWaves}
%\end{align}
%Here, $ P_{j_1}^{-\left|m\right|} $ is a Legendre function.
%It is related to Jacobi polynomial as
%\begin{align}
%	P_j^{-n} \left( \zeta \right) \propto \left( \zeta^2-1 \right)^{ \frac{1}{2} n} P_{j-n}^{n,n}\left( \zeta \right)
%	.\label{eq:JacobiIdentity}
%\end{align}
%These polynomials admit a completeness property, which was used in writing \cref{eq:5ptPartialWaves}.
%This step also uses the orthogonality of power laws $ z^m $ and $ z^{-1-m} $ when integrated of unit circle $ \left|z\right| =1 $.
%We remind the reader that this is specific to four dimensioal quantum field theories.
%Precisely, in this dimensioal the relevant isometry group for Toller angle is $ SO(2)  $.
%In general dimensions $ d  $, the harmonic function on $ SO(d) $ are Gegenbauer polynomial.
%However, in $ d  = 2 $, they degenerate to Chebyshev polynomials which admit a simplification,
%\begin{align}
%	C_m \left( x  = \cos \left( \theta \right) \right)        & = \cos \left( m \theta \right)              \nonumber \\
%	C_m \left( \frac{1}{2} \left( z + z ^{-1} \right) \right) & = \frac{1}{2} \left( z^{m } + z^{-m} \right)
%	.

%The contour runs over $ \Re \mu = -\frac{1}{2} $.
%See \cite{White:1973ola}, for more details.
%Further, we use the analyticity \cite{White:1973ola} in this variable $ z $ to arrive at the FG representation above.

%
%We can continue the functions $ a^{j_1,j_2}\left( \mu \right) $ in the variables $ j_1,j_2 $, respectively, using the techniques similar to the four point case.
%Since the analytic continuation happens again in the spin quantum numbers and the variable on which the polynomials depends are also the four point scattering angle analogues to the five point case, the same techniques can be used.

%Using the relation between the angle variables and the Mandelstam invariants, we arrive at the approximation of the amplitude in the multi Regge limit after picking possible dynamical poles in the variables $ J_1,J_2,\mu $.

%\end{align}
%However, the Steinmann relations, reviewed in \cref{app:steinmann}, impose a constraint on the allowed values of $ j_1^{*},j_2^{*},m^{*} $.
%In particular, simultaneous discontinuities in the variables $ s_1,s_{12} $ and $ s_2, s_{12} $ are not allowed.
%This means either $ j_1^{*}-m^{*} $ or $ j_2^{*}-m^{*} $ must be a positive integer.
%This implies that allowed locations of $ m^{*} $ are determined completely by the values of $ j_1^{*},j_2^{*} $.
%Note that, these relations are valid only in the physical region in a given channel.
%We have assumed that they continue to work in the asymptotic region under consideration.
%
%Inspired by these claims, we turn to the conformal field theory analogue of Regge theory.

%% The poles in $ k_{1,2},k_{3,4} $ correspond to the integrals over $ \beta_1,\beta_4 $ when the respective $ k $'s are negative integers.
%% Roughly, the poles exist for the same reason as they do for the Schwinger parameterization identity (\ref{eq:Schwinger}).
%% To evaluate the residues in these variables, we have to use integral by part several times and isolate the poles.
%% For instance, the residue in $ k_{1,2}$ and $k_{3,4} $ occur at integer values according to
%% \begin{align}

%% However, we are interested in the multi-Regge limit of this amplitude.
%% As prescribed earlier, it is a specific kinematic limit in which some of the $ k_{i,j} $'s blow up.
%% In particular, we have $ k_{1,2}$ and $k_{3,4} $ fixed while other invariants go to infinity.
%% To find the limiting value, we use the generalization of the worldsheet OPE analysis described above.
%% However, the naive OPE limit $z_2\to 0$ and $1-z_3 \to 0 $  of (\ref{eq:full5ptString}) does not give rise to the multi-Regge behavior.
%
%% The correct approach is similar to the four particle scattering case discussed above.
%% Since in this OPE limit $z_2\to 0$ and $1-z_3 \to 0 $, we have to account for the order of limit issue when the corresponding exponents go to $ \infty $.
%% We consider the multi-Regge kinematics defined earlier.
%% It can be shown that $ k_{1,3}$, $k_{2,3}$ and $k_{2,4} $ scale in the same manner to infinity.
%% Then we consider the integral as a function of $ k_{i,j} $ and discuss the multi-Regge limit.
%% First, we introduce Schwinger parameters $ x,y $ for $ |z_2| $ and $ |1-z_3| $, respectively.

%% In this section, we review the kinematics concerning the Regge theory in the Mandelstam variables.
%% Regge limit probes the high energy regime of the scattering process.
%% For the $ 2\rightarrow 2  $ scattering, it is parameterized in terms of $ s = \left(  k_1 + k_2 \right) ^{ 2} $ and $ t = \left(  k_1 + k_3 \right) ^{ 2} $.
%% $ s\rightarrow \infty $ while $ t $ fixed, plays the role of the Regge limit.
%% The generalization to higher point scattering amplitudes involves the following Mandelstam invariants \cite{Brower:1974yv,Bartels:2012gq,Caron-Huot:2020vlo} :
%% \begin{align}
%% 	s_r       & =x_{r+1,r+3}^2                                   \\
%% 	t_r       & =x_{1,r+2}^2                                     \\
%% 	\omega_p  & =\frac{x_{p-2,p}^2 x_{p-1,p+1}^2}{x_{p-2,p+1}^2} \\
%% 	x_{i,j}^2 & = \left( k_{i+1}+\cdots + k_{j} \right)^2        \\
%% 	r         & =1,\cdots,n-3                                    \\
%% 	p         & =4,\cdots,n-1
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% In $ d=4 $, this amounts to $ 3n-10 $ variables for $ n $-point scattering amplitude.
%% In $ d $-dimensional quantum field theories, the number of independent variables are $ n\left( n-1 \right)/3 $ when $ n<d+1 $, and otherwise $ \left( d-1 \right)n-d\left( d+1 \right)/2 $.
%% In words, $ s $ type invariants correspond to two body momenta just as in the case of four point scattering amplitude.
%% However, $ t $ type invariants use $ r+1 $ momenta.
%% For instance, for five point scattering amplitudes, the kinematics are as follows in terms of the external particles mass $ m $ :
%% \begin{align}
%% 	s_1    & =2 k_3\cdot k_4-2 m^2                                                                                                            \\
%% 	s_2    & =2 k_4\cdot k_5-2 m^2                                                                                                            \\
%% 	t_1    & =2 k_2\cdot k_3-2 m^2                                                                                                            \\
%% 	t_2    & =-3 m^2+2 k_2\cdot k_3+2 k_2\cdot k_4+2 k_3\cdot k_4                                                                             \\
%% 	\omega & =\frac{\left(2 k_3\cdot k_4-2 m^2\right) \left(2 k_4\cdot k_5-2 m^2\right)}{-3 m^2+2 k_3\cdot k_4+2 k_3\cdot k_5+2 k_4\cdot k_5}
%% \end{align}
%% This can be inverted in terms of the mass of external particle $ m ^{2} $, as
%% \begin{align}
%% 	k_2\cdot k_3 & = m^2+\frac{t_1}{2},                                                           \\
%% 	k_2\cdot k_4 & = \frac{1}{2} \left(-m^2-s_1-t_1+t_2\right),                                   \\
%% 	k_3\cdot k_4 & = m^2+\frac{s_1}{2},                                                           \\
%% 	k_3\cdot k_5 & = \frac{s_1 \left(s_2-\omega \right)-\omega  \left(m^2+s_2\right)}{2 \omega }, \\
%% 	k_4\cdot k_5 & = m^2+\frac{s_2}{2}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%
%% In this notation, the multi-Regge limit corresponds again to $ s_r \rightarrow  \infty $ while keeping $ t_r ,\omega$ fixed.
%% Note that, while the $ s,t $  generalize the Mandelstam invariants for 4 point scattering, some properties related to crossing do not generalize.
%% In particular, $ 4! $ permutations of the external points permute $ s,t,u $  among themselves, in the 2 to 2 scattering.
%% However, the analogous $ 5! $  permutations do not permute $ s $  and $ t $  variables.
%
%% % For instance, one such permutation maps the above variables to
%% % \begin{align}
%% % 	s_1     \rightarrow & -3 m^2+s_{ 1 } \left(\frac{s_{ 2 }}{\omega }-1\right)-s_{ 2 },           \\
%% % 	s_2     \rightarrow & s_{ 2 },                                                                 \\
%% % 	t_1     \rightarrow & t_{ 1 },                                                                 \\
%% % 	t_2     \rightarrow & -3 m^2-s_{ 2 }+t_{ 1 }-t_{ 2 },                                          \\
%% % 	\omega  \rightarrow & \frac{-3 m^2 \omega -(s_{ 1 }+s_{ 2 }) \omega +s_{ 1 } s_{ 2 }}{s_{ 1 }}
%% % 	.
%% % \end{align}
%% Therefore, we consider the Mandelstam invariants formed by product of two momenta $ k_{i,j} $.
%
%% In this section, we discuss the Regge limit and its generalization to multi-Regge limit in the specific case of string theory.
%% We will consider the Regge limit of the string theory amplitude in three different ways.
%% First, we will consider the full amplitude using worldsheet method.
%% We will use a particular limit of the Mandelstam invariants to arrive at the Regge limit of the amplitude.
%% Second, we will use the coupling constants and masses on the leading Regge trajectory to directly find the Regge limit amplitude.
%% Third, we will use a particular generalization of OPE limit on the worldsheet to arrive at the same answer.
%
%% In type II superstring theory in $ 10 $ dimensions, the $ 2\rightarrow 2 $ scattering amplitude is given by
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T\left( s,t \right)=
%% 	8\pi G_N

%% 	\frac{\Gamma\left( 1-\frac{\alpha' s}{4} \right)
%% 		\Gamma\left( 1-\frac{\alpha' t}{4} \right)
%% 		\Gamma\left( 1-\frac{\alpha' u}{4} \right)}{\Gamma\left( 1+\frac{\alpha' s}{4} \right)
%% 		\Gamma\left( 1+\frac{\alpha' t}{4} \right)
%% 		\Gamma\left( 1+\frac{\alpha' u}{4} \right)}
%% 	.
%% 	\label{eq:veneziano}
%% \end{align}
%% Here, the Mandelstam variables are constrained by $ s+t+u=4m^2 $, where $ m $ is the mass of the external particle.
%% Since, we consider dilatons, $ m=0 $.
%% We also use $ G_N $ to denote the Newton's constant.
%% One way to understand this amplitude and the spectrum of the particles exchanged is to consider a particular channel and perform the partial wave expansion in terms of the harmonic polynomials of the scattering angle $ z= \cos\left( \theta \right) = 1+2\frac{s}{t-4m^2}=1+\frac{2s}{t}$ as
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T\left( s,t \right) = \displaystyle\sum_{J=0}^{\infty}a_J\left( t \right)P_J\left( z \right)
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% The spectrum of the particle with mass $ M $ and spin $ J $ is encoded in the analytic structure of $ a_J\left( t \right) $, where the mass $ M  $ appears as a pole.
%% For the amplitude of dilatons, these poles lie at $ t=4n/\alpha' $. One can compute these residue for a given $ z $,
%% \begin{align}
%% 	\text{Res}_{t=4n/\alpha'} T & =\displaystyle\sum_{J=0}^{\infty}P_J\left( z \right) \text{Res}_{t=4n/\alpha'} a_J\left( t \right) \\
%% 	                            & =\frac{-128\pi G_N }{\left( \alpha' n \right)^2}\left( \frac{n z }{2}
%% 	\right)^{2n+2}+ O\left( z ^ {2n} \right)
%% 	.\end{align}

%% This exercise will be useful especially for the higher point case where the full amplitude is not known in terms of known mathematical functions.

%% \begin{align}
%% 	\int d^2 z |z|^{\alpha k_{3,1}} |1-z|^{\alpha k_{2,1}}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% We can compute its Regge limit directly by doing the OPE analysis on the worldsheet.
%% This involves saddle point analysis of the integral above.
%% If both the exponents are large, it is easy to show that the integral localizes at $ z= \frac{k_{1,3}}{k_{1,3}+ k_{2,1}} $.
%% However, we are interested in a limit when $ k_{1,2} \rightarrow \infty $ with $ k_{1,3} $ fixed.
%% $ z \rightarrow 0 $ corresponds to such a limit.
%% Naively, this gets the contribution from one of the particles in the theory, which is the leading pole in $ k_{1,2} $ \cite{Brower:2006ea}.
%% However, we expect the whole leading Regge trajectory to contribute in the Regge limit.
%% It can be achieved by taking the limit $ z\rightarrow   0 $ with the product $ z \cdot k_{1,2} $ fixed.
%% This allows us to compute the Regge form, denoted by $T\left( s,t \right)^\mathcal{R}  $, of the amplitude directly to be \cite{Brower:2006ea,Costa:2012cb}
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T\left( s,t \right)^\mathcal{R} \approx \frac{\Gamma\left( {-\alpha' t/4} \right)}{\Gamma\left( {1+\alpha' t/4} \right)}\left( \frac{\alpha's}{4} \right) ^{2+\frac{\alpha ' s}{4}}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% The pole structure in the variable $ t $ is explicit in the $ \Gamma $ functions.
%
%
%% We consider the higher point generalization of the analysis mentioned above.
%% The schematic formula for the string theory amplitude is \cite{Bjerrum-Bohr:2010pnr}
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T\left( k_{i,j}\right) & = \displaystyle\int \prod_{i=2}^{n-2} d^2 z_i \big|z_i\big| ^ {2 \alpha' k_1\cdot k_j} \big|z_i\big| ^ {2 \alpha' k_{n-1}\cdot k_i}\prod_{i<j\leq n-2} \big|z_j - z_i\big| ^ {2\alpha' k_i\cdot k_j}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% Specifically, for the case of five points, using gauge fixing on the conformal group to fix points at $ z_1=0,z_4=1,z_5=\infty $, it reduces to
%% \begin{align}

%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% Note that we have used implicitly the momentum conservation to get rid of $ k_5 $ dependence.
%% We follow the standard technique of Schwinger parameters to evaluate these amplitudes.
%% This amounts to repeatedly using the following identity:
%% \begin{align}
%% 	z^{-a} = \frac{1  }{\Gamma\left( a \right)} \int_0^\infty d\alpha e^{-\beta z} \beta^{a-1}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% We use it for each distance between pairs of points, introducing Schwinger parameters $ \beta_{1,\dots,5} $, as follows:
%% \begin{align}
%% 	\beta_1   &  & \beta_2   &  & \beta_3   &  & \beta_4   &  & \beta_5   \\
%% 	x^2_{1,2} &  & x^2_{1,3} &  & x^2_{3,2} &  & x^2_{2,4} &  & x^2_{3,4}
%% 	.
%% \end{align}
%% Here, $ x_{i,j} $ denote the distance between points $ i,j $.
%% Further, we use Gaussian integrals in order to evaluate all the spacetime integrals, leaving us with only the integrals over $ \beta $'s.
%% We then introduce a $ \delta $ function to introduce $ \lambda=\sum_{j=1}^{5} \beta_j $.
%% After changing the order of integration over $ \lambda $, we use the scaling in $ \beta $'s to set $ \beta_3=1 $.
%% This leaves us with four integrals over $ \beta_{1,2,4,5} $ to determine the \textit{full} amplitude.
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T_5\left( k_{i,j} \right) & = \int_0^\infty d\beta_{1,2,4,5} \mathcal{F}_{\beta_{1,2,4,5}}\left( k_{i,j} \right)
%% 	\beta _1^{-k_{1,2}-1} \beta _2^{-k_{1,3}-1} \beta _4^{-k_{2,4}-1} \beta _5^{-k_{3,4}-1}
%% 	.
%% 	\label{eq:full5ptString}
%% \end{align}
%
%% The poles in $ k_{1,2},k_{3,4} $ correspond to the integrals over $ \beta_1,\beta_4 $ when the respective $ k $'s are negative integers.
%% Roughly, the poles exist for the same reason as the Schwinger parameterization identity.
%% To evaluate the residues in these variables, we have to use integral by part several times and isolate the poles.
%% For instance, the residue in $ k_{1,2},k_{3,4} $ at $ n_1,n_2 $ is
%% \begin{align}
%% 	T_5 \equiv \sum_{n_1,n_2} \frac{ \mathcal{R}_{n_1,n_2}}{\left( k_{1,2} - n_1 \right) \left( k_{3,4} - n_2 \right) }

%% We are interested in the multi-Regge limit of this amplitude.

%
%% The correct approach is similar to the four particle scattering case discussed above.
%% Since in this OPE limit, $ z_2,1-z_3 \rightarrow 0 $ , we have to account for the order of limit issue when the corresponding exponents go to $ \infty $.

\section{Kinematics of five-point conformal correlators}
\label{sec:KinematicsFivePointCorrelators}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Correlation functions of local primary operators in any conformal field theory can be written in terms of a simple prefactor, that absorbs the weight of external operators, and a  non-trivial function that depends on conformal invariant variables, usually called cross ratios, that contains all the dynamics of the correlator.
In this chapter, we will be mostly focused in correlators involving five operators.
These depend on five different cross ratios through\footnote{This is the same number as independent Mandelstam invariants in flat space scattering amplitudes as reviewed in the previous section. The connection between correlation functions in conformal field theories and scattering amplitudes is more clear in Mellin space, as we shall see in the next section. }
\begin{align}
  \langle \mathcal{O}(x_1) \mathcal{O}(x_2) \mathcal{O}(x_3) \mathcal{O}(x_4) \mathcal{O}(x_5)  \rangle  = \frac{\left(\frac{x_{23}^2}{x_{13}^2}\right)^{\frac{\Delta_{12}}{2}} \left(\frac{x_{14}^2}{x_{13}^2}\right)^{\frac{\Delta_{34}}{2}}   }{(x_{12}^2)^{\frac{\Delta_1+\Delta_2}{2}}(x_{34}^2)^{\frac{\Delta_3+\Delta_4}{2}}} \left(\frac{x_{13}^2}{x_{15}^2x_{35}^2}\right)^{\frac{\Delta_5}{2}}\mathcal{G}(u_1\dots u_5)\,,
  \label{eq:fiveptcorrelatordef}
\end{align}
where $x_{ij}^2=(x_i-x_j)^2$, we used the shorthand notation $\Delta_{ij}\equiv \Delta_i-\Delta_j$ and the cross ratios are defined as
\begin{align}
  u_1= \frac{x_{12}^{2} x_{35}^{2}}{x_{13}^{2} x_{25}^{2}}\,,  \qquad\qquad u_{i+1} = u_{i}|_{x_{i} \rightarrow x_{i+1}}\,.
  \label{eq:crossRatiosuiFive}
\end{align}
It is worth emphasizing that this is just a particular choice of cross ratios which is obviously not unique.
For instance, $\tilde{u}_3\equiv u_3u_2$ would be as valid a choice as $u_3$.
The choice (\ref{eq:crossRatiosuiFive}) has the nice feature that the cross ratios can be defined by transforming the $x_i$ cyclically, {\em i.e.} $x_{i}\rightarrow x_{i+1}$.
This is particularly interesting when studying observables that are cyclically symmetric~\cite{Bercini:2020msp,Bercini:2021jti,Antunes:2021kmm}.

In general, $\mathcal{G}(u_i)$ is an intricate function of the cross ratios with a complex analytic structure. One interesting question is, {\em what are the allowed singularities of a correlation function of five local operators and what is their physical meaning? }
This is a hard question that we will not try to answer here in full generality (see \cite{Maldacena:2015iua} for progress in this direction).
Instead, we shall focus on a particular singularity that is associated with the limit described in figure \ref{fig:ReggeLimitVsOthers} and that is similar to the Regge limit of scattering amplitudes reviewed in the previous section.
There are two other more common (and simpler) singularities, the Euclidean and lightcone OPE limits which will be relevant for the Regge limit analysis.
Indeed, it is possible to extract some information about these singularities from the conformal block decomposition of five points
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{G}(u_i)=  \sum_{k_1k_2,\ell}P_{k_1k_2 }^{\ell}G_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}(u_1,\dots u_5)\,,
  \label{eq:confblockDecom}
\end{align}
where $G_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}(u_1,\dots u_5)$ are conformal blocks in the channel $(12)$ and $(34)$, $P_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}$ are products of three-point coefficients (to be described in more detail in the following subsection) and the sum is over all primary operators.

In the following subsections, we will review and explore the Euclidean and lightcone singularities and introduce the Regge limit for five-point correlation functions.

%Other choices of cross ratios prove more useful in analyzing different physical settings as shall be seen below.  In the following subsections we will analyze distinct physical limits of the five point correlator (\ref{eq:fiveptcorrelatordef}) and explain the physics behind them.

The simplest limit in a CFT is when two operators are brought close to each other.
In this setup, the operator product expansion (OPE) is convergent and can be used safely.
%This is a  regime where the operator product expansion (OPE) can be used safely.
The OPE is perhaps one of the most important properties of a CFT.
This feature tells that the product of two operators at distinct points can be replaced by a linear combination of operators
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{O}(x_1)\mathcal{O}(x_2) \approx \sum_{k} \frac{C_{12k}}{(x_{12}^2)^{\frac{\Delta_1+\Delta_2-(\Delta_k-J_k)}{2}}}
  %	F_k \big(x_{12}\cdot D_{z},x_{12}\cdot\partial_{x_1},x_{12}^2 \partial_{x_1}\cdot D_{z},x_{12}^2\partial_{x_1}^2\big)\mathcal{O}_k(x_1,z)\,,
  F_k \big(x_{12}, D_{z},\partial_{x_1}\big)\mathcal{O}_k(x_1,z)\,,
  \label{eq:OPEequation}
\end{align}
where the sum runs over all primary operators, $C_{12k}$ are the OPE coefficients and $F_{k}$ is a differential operator that takes into account the contribution of descendants.
The auxiliary null variable $z$ is used to encode the open indices of a symmetric and traceless spin $J$ operator as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{O}(x,z) \equiv z^{\mu_1}\dots z^{\mu_J} \mathcal{O}^{\mu_1\dots \mu_J}(x)\,,
\end{align}
while
\begin{align}
  D_{z^{\mu}} =\left( \frac{d}{2}-1+z\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right)\frac{\partial}{\partial z^\mu}-\frac{1}{2} z^ \mu \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z \cdot \partial z}
  \label{eq:TodorovOPE}
\end{align}
is used to recover the information about the indices.
%The OPE  (\ref{eq:OPEequation}) is an operator equation that can be used inside a correlation function as long as it is possible to encircle the two operators at  $x_1$ and $x_2$ with a ball with some radius while leaving the other operators outside of it.
The exact form of $F_k$ can be determined from consistency of two- and three-point correlation functions of local operators.
It follows from a simple computation that, at the leading order and in the limit $x_2\rightarrow x_1$, the function $F_k$ is given by
\begin{align}
  F_k (x_{12}, D_{z},\partial_{x_1}) = \frac{(x_{12}\cdot D_{z})^{J_k}}{J_k!\left(\frac{d}{2}-1\right)_{J_k}} +\dots\,,
  \label{eq:OPEEuclideanLEading}
\end{align}
where $\dots$ represent  subleading terms.
One feature of this simple result is that it is evident that the limit is dominated by operators with lowest dimension $ \Delta_k $.
In particular, this determines the dominant contribution of a five-point conformal block  in the limits $x_{2}\rightarrow x_1$ and $x_4\rightarrow x_3$
\begin{align}
  \sum_{\ell} P_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}G_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}(u_1,\dots u_5) \approx \tfrac{C_{12k_1}C_{34k_2} (x_{12}\cdot D_{z})^{J_1}(x_{34}\cdot D_{z'})^{J_2}}{(x_{12}^2)^{\frac{J_{1}-\Delta_{k_1}}{2}} (x_{34}^2)^{\frac{J_{2}-\Delta_{k_2}}{2}}} \langle \mathcal{O}_{k_1}(x_1,z)\mathcal{O}_{k_2}(x_3,z') \mathcal{O}(x_5) \rangle\,.
  \label{eq:leadingtermOPEBoundaryCond}
\end{align}
Note that the double limit in the pair of points $(12)$ and $(34)$ was taken to reduce the correlator to a three-point function which is fixed by symmetry as
\begin{align}
   & \langle \mathcal{O}_{k_1}(x_1,z_1)\mathcal{O}_{k_2}(x_2,z_2) \mathcal{O}(x_3) \rangle  = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\textrm{min}(J_1,J_2)}\frac{C_{123}^{\ell} V_{123}^{J_1-\ell} V_{213}^{J_2-\ell} H_{12}^{\ell}}{(x_{12}^2)^{\frac{h_1+h_2-h_3}{2}} (x_{13}^2)^{\frac{h_1+h_3-h_2}{2}} (x_{23}^2)^{\frac{h_2+h_3-h_1}{2}}   } \,,
  \label{eq:threepontfunction}
\end{align}
where $h_i\equiv \Delta_i+J_i$ and
\begin{align}
   & H_{12} = (z_1\cdot x_{12})(z_2\cdot x_{12})- \frac{x_{12}^2  (z_1\cdot z_2)}{2}\,, \ \ \ \ \ V_{123} = \frac{(z_1\cdot x_{12} )x_{13}^2- (z_1\cdot x_{13})x_{12}^2}{x_{23}^2}\,.
\end{align}
It follows  from (\ref{eq:leadingtermOPEBoundaryCond}) that the constants $P_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}$ are given by
\begin{align}
  P_{k_1k_2}^{\ell} & =C_{12k_1}C_{34k_2}C_{k_1k_25}^{\ell} \,.
  \label{eq:OPE_coeffs}
\end{align}

Conformal blocks are complicated functions which are not known in closed form for general dimensions.
However, it is possible to compute them as an expansion around some limits.
One method to obtain them takes advantage of the fact that they are eigenfunctions of the conformal Casimir differential equation
\begin{align}
  \left(\mathcal{D}_{12} -c_{\Delta_{k_1},J_1}\right) G_{k_1k_2}^{\ell}=0\,,
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
  c_{\Delta,J} =\Delta  (\Delta -d)+J (d+J-2)\,, \qquad
  \mathcal{D}_{12} = 2u_1^2\partial_{u_1}^2+\dots\,,
\end{align}
where $\dots$ represent other subleading terms.
%  which are spelled out in appendix \ref{app:CasimirEquationDetails}. \textbf{AS:appendix to be added.Is it necessary?}
We omitted an analogous equation in the $(34)$ channel that can be obtained using symmetry.

The cross ratios (\ref{eq:crossRatiosuiFive}) are not appropriate for all situations.
For instance, in the limit considered above where $x_2\rightarrow x_1$ and $x_4\rightarrow x_3$, one has
\begin{align}
  u_1,u_3\rightarrow 0\,, \ \ \ \  \ \ \ u_i\rightarrow 1 \ \ \ (i=2,4,5)\,,
\end{align}
which is insensitive to the angle at which the operators approach each other.
For this limit, it is preferable to use instead another set of cross ratios\footnote{We have decided to use slightly different angles as compared with \cite{Goncalves:2019znr} to make it appear more symmetric in the variables $u_i$. }\cite{Goncalves:2019znr}
\begin{align}
  \xi_1  =\frac{1-u_5}{2 \sqrt{u_1}}                                        \,,\qquad
  \xi_2  =\frac{1-u_4}{2 \sqrt{u_3} }                               \,,     \qquad
  \xi_3  =\frac{ u_2-1}{2 \sqrt{u_1} \sqrt{u_3}}\,,
  \label{eq:anglesdef}
\end{align}
which remain finite.
These are related to the angles just mentioned above.
The leading behavior, in the Euclidean OPE limit, of the five-point conformal block can be written in terms of these new cross ratios as
\begin{align}
   & G_{k_1k_2}^{\ell} = u_1^{\frac{\Delta_{k_1}}{2}}u_3^{\frac{\Delta_{k_2}}{2}}\mathcal{H}_{\ell}(\xi_i)      \,,
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{H}_{\ell}(\xi_i)=\prod_{i=1}^2\frac{1}{J_i!\left(\frac{d}{2}-1\right)_{J_i}} \frac{(x_{12}\cdot D_{z})^{J_1}(x_{34}\cdot D_{z'})^{J_2}}{(x_{12}^2)^{\frac{J_{k_1}}{2}} (x_{34}^2)^{\frac{J_{k_2}}{2}}} \frac{V_{135}^{J_1-\ell} V_{315}^{J_2-\ell} H_{13}^{\ell}}{(x_{13}^2)^{\frac{J_1+J_3}{2}} (x_{15}^2)^{\frac{J_1-J_2}{2}} (x_{35}^2)^{\frac{J_2-J_1}{2}}   }\,.
  \label{eq:nonfactorizedH}
\end{align}
A brute force implementation of the action of the operators $D_{z}$ and $D_{z'}$ on the previous expression for the function $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ will lead to a rather complicated sum \cite{Goncalves:2019znr} that we do not show since it will not be important in the discussion. A simple analysis reveals that the leading term of $\mathcal{H}_\ell$ in the limit $\xi_{1,2}\rightarrow \lambda \xi_{1,2},\, \xi_3\rightarrow \xi_3\lambda^2$ for large
$\lambda$, which corresponds to considering lightcone limits\footnote{In this limit we can discard the second term in the differential operator $D_z$ which in turn makes its action easier to implement. This just corresponds to throwing away the contribution of terms associated with traces.  } $x_{12}^2,x_{34}^2\rightarrow 0$, is of the form
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{H}_\ell \approx \xi_{1}^{J_1-\ell}\xi_{2}^{J_2-\ell} \xi_3^{\ell} +\dots\,, \label{eq:leadingtermHfunction}
\end{align}
where the $\dots$ represent subleading terms.  Alternatively we can use the Casimir differential equation, in the Euclidean limit, to obtain subleading terms in (\ref{eq:leadingtermHfunction})
\begin{align}
   & \displaystyle {\!\!\!\!\big[(1-\xi_1^2)\partial_{\xi_1}^2+(1-\xi_3^2)\partial_{\xi_3}^2-(d-1)(\xi_1\partial_{\xi_1}+\xi_3\partial_{\xi_3})-2(\xi_1\xi_3+\xi_2)\partial_{\xi_1}\partial_{\xi_3}+C_{J_1}\big]\mathcal{H}_{\ell}=0}\,,
  \label{eq:AngulardifferentialEquation}                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\
   & \displaystyle {\!\!\!\!\big[(1-\xi_2^2)\partial_{\xi_2}^2+(1-\xi_3^2)\partial_{\xi_3}^2-(d-1)(\xi_2\partial_{\xi_2}+\xi_3\partial_{\xi_3})-2(\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_1)\partial_{\xi_2}\partial_{\xi_3}+C_{J_2}\big]\mathcal{H}_{\ell}=0}\,,
  \nonumber
\end{align}
with $C_J=J(J+2h-2)$.
It is essential in extracting the dots in (\ref{eq:leadingtermHfunction}) from the Casimir equation to assume that $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ is polynomial in the variables $\xi_i$.
However, this follows from the definition (\ref{eq:nonfactorizedH}).

It turns out that, after changing the cross ratio $\xi_3$ to $\zeta$ defined by\footnote{These cross ratios were introduced in the context of conformal field theories in \cite{Buric:2021kgy}. }
\begin{align}
  \xi_3= -\xi_1\xi_2 +\zeta \sqrt{(1-\xi_1^2)(1-\xi_2^2)}\,,
\end{align}
the Casimir differential equation becomes much simpler
\begin{align}
  \bigg[J_1 \left(d+J_1-2\right) +\frac{(d-2) \zeta \partial_{\zeta}+(\zeta^2-1) \partial_{\zeta}^2 }{\xi _1^2-1}+(1-d) \xi _1\partial_{\xi _1} +(1-\xi _1^2) \partial_{\xi _1}^2 \bigg] \mathcal{H}\,,=0\label{eq:differentialequationHNewangle}
\end{align}
with an analogous equation for $J_2$. This form of the differential equation allows to look for solutions with a factorized form
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\mathcal{H}} = f_1(\xi_1) f_2(\xi_2) g(\zeta) \,,
  \label{eq:factorizePolynomial}
\end{align}
where we have used tilde to emphasize that the solution is factorized and possibly different from (\ref{eq:nonfactorizedH}).
The function $g(\zeta)$ satisfies a differential equation that can be read from (\ref{eq:differentialequationHNewangle})
\begin{align}
  \big[(\zeta^2-1)\partial_{\zeta}^2 +(d-2)\zeta \partial_{\zeta}+\ell' (\ell'+d-3) \big] g_{\ell'} = 0\,,
  \label{eq:ellDiffequation}
\end{align}
where the separation constant $\ell' (\ell'+d-3) $ was chosen for convenience.
One solution to this differential equation that is polynomial in $\zeta$ is given by
\begin{align}
  g_{\ell'}  = \,_2F_1\left(-\ell',\ell'+d-3,\frac{d-2}{2},\frac{1-\zeta}{2}\right)
   & = \,\frac{\ell'!\Gamma(2h-3)}{\Gamma(2h+\ell'-3)} \,C_{\ell'}^{\frac{d-3}{2}}  (\zeta)\,.
\end{align}
This is clearly a polynomial of degree $\ell'$.
It is also simple to check that
\begin{align}
  f_1(\xi_1) = (1-\xi_1^2)^\frac{\ell'}{2} C_{J_1-\ell'}^{\frac{d-2}{2}+\ell'}(\xi_1)\,,
\end{align}
is a solution to the differential equation arising from (\ref{eq:differentialequationHNewangle}). The solution $f_2$ can be obtained analogously.
It can also be checked that this new solution  $ \tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{\ell'}$ is consistent with the non-factorized $\mathcal{H}_\ell$ in (\ref{eq:nonfactorizedH}). Let us see how in more detail.

Both $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ and $ \tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{\ell'}$ satisfy the same differential equation, however they are not the same function. Nevertheless
it is possible to express  $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ in terms of $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ and vice-versa, that is
\begin{align}
   & \tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{\ell'} = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\ell'}  C_{\ell \ell'} \mathcal{H}_{\ell} \,, \qquad
  %\sum_{\ell'=0}^{\ell}  \tilde{c}_{\ell'} \tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{\ell'} = \mathcal{H}_{\ell}\,.
  \label{eq:equationchangebasis}
\end{align}
The coefficients $C_{\ell\ell'}$ can be thought as a change of basis of three-point functions. To determine them it is useful to take the limit $\xi_{1,2}\rightarrow \lambda \xi_{1,2}$ and $\xi_3 =\xi_3 \lambda^2$, with $\lambda$ large. In this limit the functions $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{\ell} $ behave as
\begin{align}
   & \mathcal{H}_\ell \approx \xi_1^{J_1-\ell}\xi_2^{J_2-\ell} \xi_3^{\ell} +\dots \,,\qquad
  \tilde{\mathcal{H}}_{\ell'} \approx \xi_1^{J_1}\xi_2^{J_2} g_{\ell'} (\zeta)+\dots\,,
\end{align}
where $\zeta\rightarrow (\xi_1\xi_2+\xi_3)/(\xi_1\xi_2)$ and the $\dots$ represent subleading terms.
Using the previous equation and (\ref{eq:equationchangebasis}) we can find the coefficients.
Let us start by  $C_{\ell\ell'}$,
\begin{align}
  \xi_1^{J_1}\xi_2^{J_2} \sum_{\ell=0}^{\ell'} C_{\ell \ell'}  \left(\frac{\xi_3}{\xi_1\xi_2}\right)^\ell  = \xi_1^{J_1}\xi_2^{J_2}  g_{\ell'} (\zeta) = \xi_1^{J_1}\xi_2^{J_2}  \sum_{k=0}^{\ell'} \frac{\left(-\ell'\right)_k\left(\ell'+d-3\right)_k}{k!\left(\frac{d-2}{2}\right)_k} \left(\frac{1-\zeta}{2}\right)^k \,,
\end{align}
where $\xi_3/(\xi_1\xi_2)=\zeta-1$. The coefficients $C_{\ell\ell'}$ can be obtained straightaway leading to
\begin{align}
  C_{\ell\ell'}=  \frac{\left(-\ell'\right)_\ell\left(\ell'+d-3\right)_\ell}{\ell!\left(\frac{d-2}{2}\right)_\ell 2^{\ell}} \,.
\end{align}
To find the inverse relation we make use of the identity
\begin{align}
  \sum_{\ell'=0}^\ell \frac{(c)_{\ell} {{\ell}\choose{\ell'}} (b+2\ell')(-1)^{\ell'}}{(b+1+\ell')_{\ell} (b+\ell')} \,_2F_1\left(-\ell',b+\ell',c,\frac{x}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{\ell}\,,
\end{align}
for any variable $x$ and constants $b$ and $c$. Using this  equation  the  inverse matrix  $\tilde{C}_{\ell'\ell}$ follows immediately
\begin{align}
  \tilde{C}_{\ell'\ell} = \frac{(-1)^{\ell' } (d+2 \ell' -3) \binom{\ell }{\ell' } \left(\frac{d-2}{2}\right)_{\ell }}{(d+\ell' -3) (d+\ell' -2)_{\ell }} \,.
\end{align}
This concludes the change of basis from (\ref{eq:threepontfunction}) to the one that leads to  (\ref{eq:factorizePolynomial}), which we call factorized basis.
In this basis, the three-point function can be written as~\footnote{Note that, for integer $\ell$, the hypergeometric reduces to a polynomial,
  $$_2F_1\left(-\ell,\ell+d-3,\frac{d-2}{2},\frac{H_{12}}{2V_{123}V_{213}}\right)=\sum_{\ell'=0}^{\ell} \frac{\left(-\ell\right)_{\ell'}\left(\ell+d-3\right)_{\ell'}}{\ell'!\left(\frac{d-2}{2}\right)_{\ell'} 2^{\ell'}}\left(\frac{H_{12}}{2V_{123}V_{213}}\right)^{\ell'}=\sum_{\ell'=0}^{\ell} C_{\ell'\ell}\left(\frac{H_{12}}{2V_{123}V_{213}}\right)^{\ell'}\,.$$}
\begin{align}
  \langle \mathcal{O}_{k_1}(x_1,z_1)\dots\mathcal{O}(x_3) \rangle=\frac{V_{123}^{J_1}V_{213}^{J_2}\sum_{\ell=0}^{\textrm{min}(J_1,J_2)}\tilde{C}_{\ell}\ \,_2F_1\left(-\ell,\ell+d-3,\frac{d-2}{2},\frac{H_{12}}{2V_{123}V_{213}}\right) }{(x_{12}^2)^{\frac{h_1+h_2-h_3}{2}} (x_{13}^2)^{\frac{h_1+h_3-h_2}{2}} (x_{23}^2)^{\frac{h_2+h_3-h_1}{2}}}\,,
\end{align}
where $\tilde{C}_{\ell}$ are the OPE coefficients in the new basis.
Let us remark that this is still  polynomial in the structures $V$ and $H$, as it should. The factorized basis for the leading behaviour of the block in the Euclidean OPE limit is a new result.

\subsection{Lightcone limit}\label{sec:lightcone}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The distance between two operators, in Lorentzian kinematics, can be small when one of them approaches the lightcone of the other.
This is in contrast with what has been analyzed in the previous subsection where the operators were actually close in the Euclidean sense.
The OPE and more generally correlation functions are naturally organized, in this limit, in terms of distances between the almost null related operators.
%The OPE and more generally correlation functions are naturally organized, in this limit, in terms of squares of differences between the null related operators.
For example, the leading term in $F_k$ of (\ref{eq:OPEequation}), in the limit $x_{12}^2\rightarrow 0$, is given by
\begin{align}
  F_{k} = (x_{12}\cdot \partial_{z_1})^{J_k} \int_{0}^{1} [dt]  \, e^{tx_{12}\cdot \partial_{x_1} }\,,\label{eq:lightconeLeadingSpin}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  [dt] \equiv \frac{\Gamma(\Delta_k+J_k)}{\Gamma^2(\frac{\Delta_k+J_k}{2})} \,\big(t(1-t)\big)^{\frac{\Delta_k+J_k}{2}-1}dt
\end{align}
for spin $J_k$ operators.
For exchanged scalar operators, it is also easy to write down the formula for $F_k$, including all subleading corrections,
\begin{align}
  F_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-x_{12}^2)^{n} \left(\frac{\Delta-a}{2}\right)_n\left(\frac{\Delta+a}{2}\right)_n}{2^{2n} (\Delta)_{2n} (\tfrac{2\Delta-d}{2})_n\, n!} \,_1F_1\left(\frac{2n+\Delta+a}{2},2n+\Delta,x_{21}\cdot \partial_{x_1}\right) (\partial_{x_1}^2)^{n} \,,
  \label{eq:lightconeScalarAll}
\end{align}
with $a=\Delta_{12}$ and $\,_1F_1(a,b,x)=\int_{0}^{1}dt \, \tfrac{t^{a-1}(1-t)^{b-a-1}\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b-a)} \,e^{t x}$.
In turn, these two formulae can be used to derive the five-point conformal blocks in the lightcone limit by just applying the OPE formula to a five-point correlator. For the leading term of spinning lightcone conformal blocks we have
\begin{align}
  G_{k_1k_2,J_1,J_2}^{\ell} =u_1^{\frac{\Delta_{J_1}-J_1}{2}} u_3^{\frac{\Delta_{J_2}-J_2}{2}} (1-u_2)^{\ell}u_5^{\frac{\Delta_\phi}{2}}  \int_{0}^{1}[dt_1][dt_2] \, \mathcal{I}
  \label{eq:lightconeblocksspins}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{I}=\tfrac{\big(1-t_1(1-u_2)u_4-u_2u_4\big)^{J_2-\ell}\big(1-t_2(1-u_2)u_5-u_2u_5\big)^{J_1-\ell}}{ \big(1-(1-u_4)t_2\big)^{\frac{h_2-\tau_1-2\ell+\Delta_\phi}{2}}\big(1-(1-u_5)t_1\big)^{\frac{h_1-\tau_2-2\ell+\Delta_\phi}{2}} \big(1-(1-t_1)(1-t_2)(1-u_2)\big)^{\frac{h_1+h_2-\Delta_\phi}{2}}}\,.
\end{align}
For the scalar blocks in the  lightcone  we can write % {\bf should be $dt$ or $[dt]$ below?}
\begin{align}
  G_{k_1k_200}^{0} = \sum_{n_1,n_2=0}^{\infty} u_1^{\frac{\Delta_{k_1}+2n_1}{2}} u_3^{\frac{\Delta_{k_2}+2n_2}{2}} u_{2}^{\frac{\Delta_{21}}{2}}u_4^{\frac{2n_1+\Delta_{34}-\Delta_5+\Delta_{k_1}}{2}}u_5^{\frac{2n_2+\Delta_{21}+\Delta_{k_2} }{2}}\int_{0}^{1}dt_1dt_2  \, \tilde{\mathcal{I}}_{n_1,n_2}\,,
  \label{eq:scalarblockslightcone}
\end{align}
where the formula for $\tilde{\mathcal{I}}_{n_1,n_2}$ is shown in appendix \ref{app:Blocks}. The cross ratios $u_i$ are appropriate to describe the lightcone limit $x_{12}^2, x_{34}^2\rightarrow 0$, as only two of them go
to zero while the others remain fixed.

One feature that is evident from the formulae above is that this limit is dominated by operators that have lowest twist, defined by $\Delta-J$. Hints of this property are already present in (\ref{eq:OPEequation}) and (\ref{eq:OPEEuclideanLEading}).

Another interesting attribute of the lightcone block is that it allows to probe Lorentzian regimes, this in sharp contrast with the Euclidean expansion (\ref{eq:factorizePolynomial}) that is only valid when the point $x_2$ is in the vicinity of $x_1$. In particular, the integral formulation of both (\ref{eq:lightconeLeadingSpin}) and (\ref{eq:lightconeScalarAll}) is specially suitable to study  monodromies of the block.

%For example, this has enabled a countless results from conformal bootstrap equations.  As we shall be discussed below, the importance of this limit  stems from the fact that they the allow to probe some regions of  Lorentzian regime of the blocks.

The limits described in the previous section shared a common feature as they could be taken in a kinematics where all points are still spacelike separated from each other. This is a significant restriction on the positions of   operators and the physics that one is probing with a given correlation function. The goal of this subsection is to introduce and describe   another limit, the Regge limit,   as depicted in figure \ref{fig:ReggeLimitVsOthers}. The main novelty is that some points are timelike related, while others are still spacelike separated, more concretely the pairs of points $(1,4), (2,3),(3,5), (2,5)$ are timelike, while the other pairs remain spacelike. The configuration represented in figure    \ref{fig:ReggeLimitVsOthers} can be parametrized by the following variables
\begin{align}
  x_1 & = -r \left( \sinh  \delta_1  , \cosh   \delta_1 ,\textbf{0}_{d-2}\right), \label{eq:Reggelimitcoordinates}                                       &
  x_2 & = r \left( \sinh   \delta_2 , \cosh  \delta_2  ,\textbf{0}_{d-2}\right),                                                                           \\
  x_3 & =  \left( -\sinh   \delta_2 , \cosh  \delta_2  ,\textbf{0}_{d-2}\right),                                                                         &
  x_4 & =  \left( \sinh   \delta_1 , -\cosh  \delta_1   ,\textbf{0}_{d-2}\right),   \qquad	x_5  =  \left( 0,h_1,h_2,\textbf{0}_{d-3} \right) .  \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\delta_{i}$ are being taken to infinity and $r$ and $h_i$ can assume generic values. Here we also use a $d$-dimensional vector of zeros denoted by $\textbf{0}_{d}$. This configuration can also be written in terms of the cross ratios $u_i$ as
\begin{align}
   & u_1 = \frac{4 r^2 \left(x_5^2+1-2 h_1 \cosh\delta _2\right)}{\left(1+r^2+2 r \cosh\delta\right) \left(x_5^2+r^2-2 h_1 r \cosh \delta _1\right)}\,,
  \qquad u_2= \left(\frac{1+r^2-2 r \cosh \delta}{1+r^2+2 r \cosh\delta}\right)^2,
  \nonumber                                                                                                                                             \\
   & u_3= \frac{4 \left(x_5^2+r^2-2 h_1 r \cosh\delta _1\right)}{ \left(1+r^2+2 r \cosh\delta\right)\left(x_5^2+1-2 h_1 \cosh\delta_2\right)}\,,
  \\
  % & u_4= \frac{\left(x_5^2+1+2 h_1 \cosh \delta_2\right) \left(1+r^2+2 r \cosh\delta\right)}{\left(x_5^2+1-2 h_1 \cosh\delta_2\right) \left(1+ r^2-2 r \cosh\delta\right)}\,,
   & u_4= \frac{1}{\sqrt{u_2}}\frac{x_5^2+1+2 h_1 \cosh \delta_2 }{x_5^2+1-2 h_1 \cosh\delta_2} \,,
  \qquad\qquad\qquad\ \
  % & u_5= \frac{\left(1+r^2+2 r \cosh\delta \right) \left(x_5^2+r^2+ 2 h_1 r \cosh\delta _1\right)}{\left(1+r^2-2 r \cosh\delta\right) \left(x_5^2+r^2-2 h_1 r \cosh\delta _1\right)}\,, 
  u_5= \frac{1}{\sqrt{u_2}}\frac{x_5^2+r^2+ 2 h_1 r \cosh\delta _1}{x_5^2+r^2-2 h_1 r \cosh\delta _1} \,,
  \nonumber
\end{align}
where  $\delta=\delta_{1}+\delta_2$ and $x_5^2=h_1^2+h_2^2$. It is simple to see that both $u_1$ and $u_3$ approach zero as the $\delta_i$ are sent to infinity and that the remaining $u_i$ go to $1$
(note that $u_2$ approaches $1$ faster then the other two cross ratios). This limit, in terms of cross ratios, is the same as the Euclidean OPE limit discussed in section \ref{subsec:Euclideanlimitsubsection}.  The main distinction between these two limits resides in the different causal ordering of the operators. The similarity to the Euclidean OPE limit should come as  no surprise to the reader that is familiar with Regge limit for four points.
In reality there is a simple reason for this to be the case as one can also interpret this configuration as an OPE limit between $1^+$ and $2$, as well as $3$ and $4^-$, where  $1^+$ and $4^-$ are defined
respectively as the image of the points $1$ and $4$ on the next and previous Poincar\'e patch on the Lorentzian cylinder. This is shown in  figure \ref{fig:ReggeLimitVsOthers}.

The fifth point is kind of a spectator in this limit.
Nonetheless, it is important as it allows to introduce other parameters to differentiate the gaps $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$.
This is essentially the same as we already see in the Regge limit of five-point scattering amplitudes.

Note that in this section we made a choice of analytic continuation but there are other possible ways to attain Regge kinematics. Indeed, with some care, one can even move the fifth point in other directions and even boost it and find similar OPE behaviour after lightcones are crossed. The latter can be used as a guiding principle when we look for Regge kinematics. In Appendix~\ref{sec:otherregge}, we present some additional kinematics and path continuations that might be useful in understanding single-Reggeon exchanges or the Regge limit six-point functions in CFTs .

%	{\bf Mention boosts, physical interpretation and Pedro question. }

As mentioned before, the different causal relations between the points have important consequences. The analysis of the correlator in this setting is more elaborate and for this reason we devote the next section to it.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Conformal partial waves}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The conformal block decomposition (\ref{eq:confblockDecom}) is not the most appropriate option to analyze the Regge limit of corrrelation functions.
A better alternative is to do the so-called conformal partial wave decomposition
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{G}(u_i) = \sum_{J_i=0}^{\infty}\sum_{\ell=0}^{\textrm{min}(J_1,J_2)}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{d\nu_1}{2 \pi i }\frac{d\nu_2}{2 \pi i } \,b_{J_1J_2}^{\ell}(\nu_1,\nu_2)\, F_{\nu_1,\nu_2,J_1,J_2,\ell}(u_i)\,,
\end{align}
where the conformal partial wave coefficient  $b_{J_1J_2}^{\ell}(\nu_1,\nu_2)$ contains all the dynamical information of the correlation function, {\em {i.e.}} dimensions and OPE coefficients. The function $F_{\nu_1,\nu_2,J_1,J_2,\ell}(u_i)$ is the conformal partial wave defined by the integral
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:confPartialWaveFivePoints}
  F_{\nu_1,\nu_2,J_1,J_2,\ell}(u_i) = & \tfrac{(x_{12}^2x_{34}^2)^{\Delta_{\phi}}(x_{15}^2x_{35}^2)^{\frac{\Delta_{\phi}}{2}} }{(x_{13}^2)^{\frac{\Delta_{\phi}}{2}}} \int d^dx_6 \, d^dx_7\, \langle \mathcal{O}_{\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_1}(x_6,D_{z_1})\mathcal{O}_{\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_2}(x_7,D_{z_2})  \mathcal{O}(x_5) \rangle^{(\ell)}  \nonumber \\
                                        & \times \langle \mathcal{O}(x_1)\mathcal{O}(x_2) \mathcal{O}_{\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_1}(x_6,z_1) \rangle \langle \mathcal{O}(x_3)\mathcal{O}(x_4) \mathcal{O}_{\frac{d}{2} +i\nu_2}(x_7,z_2) \rangle\,,
\end{align}
where the $\langle \rangle^{(\ell)}$ should be understood as the term proportional to  $C_{123}^{\ell}$ in (\ref{eq:threepontfunction}) (in other words, it is just the space dependence of the three-point function) and $D_{z}$ is the differential operator defined in (\ref{eq:TodorovOPE}).  It is simple to see that both integrals in $x_6$ and $x_7$ are conformal and that $F_{\nu_i,J_i,\ell}$ should satisfy the conformal Casimir equation in the channels $(12)$ and $(34)$ with eigenvalue $C_{\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_1,J}$ and $C_{\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_2,J_2}$, respectively. In particular, this implies that the conformal partial wave can be written as a linear combination of
conformal blocks which solve the same equation
\begin{align}
  \!\!F_{\nu_1,\nu_2,J_i,\ell}  = \sum_{\tilde{\ell}}\sum_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2 =\pm}
  A_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2}^{\ell\tilde{\ell}} G_{\frac{d}{2}+i \alpha_1 \nu_1,\frac{d}{2}+i\alpha_2 \nu_2,J_i }^{\tilde{\ell}} (u_i) \,,
  % \left(c_1G_{\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_1,\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_2,J_i }^{\tilde{\ell}}+c_2 G_{\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_1,\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_2,J_i }^{\tilde{\ell} }+c_3G_{\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_1,\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_2,J_i }^{\tilde{\ell} }+c_4 G_{\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_1,\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_2,J_i }^{\tilde{\ell} }\right),
  \label{eq:conformalpartialwave}
\end{align}
where we used the symmetry of the eigenvalue $C_{\frac{d}{2}+i\nu_i,J_i} = C_{\frac{d}{2}-i\nu_i,J_i}$. The sum
over $\tilde{\ell}$ appears because the Casimir equation  is not able to fix it, and so in principle we can have a sum over this number.
%The coefficients $c_i$ can be determined by analyzing the $u_1,u_3\rightarrow 0$ of both the left and right hand sides. Let us outline the steps of this procedure and defer the more technical details to the appendix. 
The coefficients $A^{\ell\tilde{\ell}}$ were determined in \cite{Antunes:2021kmm} and are expressed in terms of several sums. It would be interesting to see if the coefficients in the new basis introduced in \ref{subsec:Euclideanlimitsubsection} are simpler and, more importantly for this work, analytic in spin.
The conformal partial waves have the advantage that are Euclidean single valued\footnote{Conformal partial waves are single valued for integer $J$. It should be possible to add a term to them to make them single valued for positive real $J$ as was done in \cite{Caron-Huot:2020nem} for four points. We hope to return to this point in the future.  }.
Recall that the correlator also enjoys this property in contrast with a single conformal block.

\section{Regge theory}
\label{sec:ReggeTheoryCFT}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Wick rotation or how to go Lorentzian}\label{sec:EucToLorent}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Regge limit of a correlation function is an intrinsically Lorentzian limit that explores a specific causal configuration of the operators.
On the other hand, CFTs have been better understood in Euclidean space.
It is thus important to understand how to analytically continue from Euclidean to Lorentzian space and what can we say about convergence and other properties of the Lorentzian correlator from CFT axioms. These questions have only very recently been discussed in firmer grounds in~\cite{Kravchuk:2020scc,Kravchuk:2021kwe}, extending the works of L\"{u}scher and Mack~\cite{Luscher:1974ez, Mack:1976pa}.
However, there the analysis focuses only on correlation functions of $n\leq 4$ points and no systematic study for higher-point functions exists to date.~\footnote{This seems to be technically challenging (see discussion of Appendix B of~\cite{Kravchuk:2021kwe}) but we hope that our results may also increase the motivation of community to tackle these questions on higher-point functions.}
%This seems to be technically challenging (see discussion of Appendix B of~\cite{Kravchuk:2021kwe}) but we hope that our results may also increase the motivation of community to tackle these questions on higher-point functions.

We want to consider Lorentzian invariant correlation functions of local operators that commute at spacelike separated points,
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{W}\left(x_1, x_2,\dots,x_n\right)=\langle \mathcal{O}(x_1)\mathcal{O}(x_2)\dots \mathcal{O}(x_n)\rangle\,.
\end{align}
These are called Wightman functions (or distributions). In particular, note that up to spacelike separated points, different orders of local operators give rise to different Wightman functions. We stress that these are not the standard time-ordered correlation functions one encounters in QFT textbooks. In fact, one can decompose time-ordered correlation functions in terms of Wightman functions\footnote{We  assume the existence of a Hilbert space with a unique vacuum $\Omega$ under the unitary action of the Poincar\'e group. We can however talk about Wightman distributions without making any such assumption since Wightman's reconstrution theorem guarantees that we would find a Hilbert space once we assumed spectral and positivity properties of the distributions - see ~\cite{Kravchuk:2021kwe, Streater:1989vi}.}
\begin{align}
   & \langle \Omega | T\{\mathcal{O}(x_1) \mathcal{O}(x_2) \dots \mathcal{O}(x_n)\} | \Omega \rangle=                                                                                         \\
   & =\langle \Omega| \mathcal{O}(t_1,\mathbf{x_1}) \mathcal{O}(t_2, \mathbf{x_2}) \dots \mathcal{O}(t_n,\mathbf{x_n})| \Omega\rangle \theta(t_1>t_2>\dots>t_n)+ \text{permutations}\nonumber \\
   & =\mathcal{W}(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)\theta(t_1>t_2>\dots>t_n)+ \text{permutations}\nonumber\,.
\end{align}
One Wightman axiom states that Wightman functions are indeed tempered distributions even at coincident points.
%~\footnote{There are many other properties that Wightman distributions satisfy that we will not describe here. The interested reader may find all the details, for instance, in~\cite{Kravchuk:2021kwe}.} 
This means that when integrated against test functions belonging to Schwartz class $f(x_i)\in \mathcal{S}$, the following integral is finite
\begin{equation}
  \int d^d x_1\dots d^d x_1 \mathcal{W}(x_1,\dots,x_n) f(x_1)\dots f(x_n)<\infty\,.
\end{equation}

Our goal is to reach a Wightman correlation function with a given order starting from a translational- and rotational-invariant Euclidean one. The basic idea is that there should be some holomorphic function $G(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ that reduces to a Lorentzian correlator in a given limit and to a Euclidean one in another. Let us then consider a real-analytic (away from coincident points) Euclidean correlator,
with operators at $x_i=(\tau_i, \textbf{x}_i)$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:euclcorr0}
  \langle  \mathcal{O}(\tau_1,\textbf{x}_1)\mathcal{O}(\tau_2,\textbf{x}_2)\dots\mathcal{O}(\tau_n,\textbf{x}_n)\rangle^{E}\,,
\end{equation}
where Euclidean times $\tau_i$ are ordered $\tau_1>\tau_2>\dots>\tau_n$. Recall that this ordering is necessary. If we assume the existence of a Hilbert space and a Hamiltonian that is bounded from below, we get that our Euclidean correlator can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:euclcorr1}
  \langle \Omega| \mathcal{O}(0,\textbf{x}_1)e^{-H(\tau_1-\tau_2)}\mathcal{O}(0,\textbf{x}_2)e^{-H(\tau_2-\tau_3)}\dots\mathcal{O}(\tau_n,\textbf{x}_n) |\Omega\rangle^{E}\,,
\end{equation}
where we use the Heisenberg representation of the field operators $\mathcal{O}$. To avoid high-energy states being exponentially enhanced,
%\footnote{That this would happen can easily be seen from the introduction of a complete set of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator between operators.}
we immediately recognise that the Euclidean correlator needs to be ``time-ordered".

To move towards a Lorentzian configuration, we want to consider an analytic continuation of the Euclidean correlator. This is achieved  by taking $\tau_i\to \epsilon_i+i t_i$. Heuristically, adding the imaginary parts does not harm the convergence,  as long as we keep  $\epsilon_1>\dots>\epsilon_n$. This analytic continuation defines our function $G(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ that is holomorphic in $\tau_i= \epsilon_i+i t_i$ and real-analytic in $\textbf{x}_i$. We can then find a Lorentzian correlator by sending $\epsilon_i\to0$ while keeping the order of limits,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:wightmancorrdef}
  \langle \Omega| \mathcal{O}(t_1,\textbf{x}_1)\dots\mathcal{O}(t_n,\textbf{x}_n) |\Omega\rangle\equiv \lim_{\underset{\epsilon_1>\dots>\epsilon_n}{\epsilon_i\to0}}	\langle \Omega| \mathcal{O}(\epsilon_1+i t_1,\textbf{x}_1)\dots\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n+i t_n,\textbf{x}_n) |\Omega\rangle^{E}\,.
\end{align}
This formally defines our Wightman function $\mathcal{W}(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. Note that to achieve different orderings we should start from an Euclidean correlator in a different ordering.
Holomorphicity may however be lost as we take $\epsilon_i \to 0$. We expect nonetheless the correlator to converge at least in a distributional sense. For CFT Wightman functions, the authors in~\cite{Kravchuk:2021kwe} found powerlaw bounds and used Vladimirov's theorem to assure that indeed this limit converges at least in the distributional sense (even at coincident points) for $n\leq 4$-point functions in Minkowski space.\footnote{All the remaining Wightman axioms were also proved from standard axioms of translational- and rotational- invariant Euclidean correlators.}
% (\textbf{No proof for Lorentzian cylinder yet. Worth saying that a paper must come out in the future?})

We want to consider the Regge limit of CFT five-point functions of identical scalars.
In this context, we are interested in correlation functions where the operator ordering is consistent with time ordering. Using the causal relations of figure~\ref{fig:ReggeLimitVsOthers}, we take
%  (\textbf{note the difference compared to figure. The other choice, it is the $u_3$ that rotates not $u_4$.})
\begin{align}
  \langle\phi(x_4)\phi(x_1)\phi(x_2)\phi(x_5)\phi(x_3)\rangle\,,

% \end{figure}
where permutations between spacelike separated operators are equivalent. As we approach the Regge kinematics, starting from a configuration where all operators are spacelike separated (essentially equivalent to a Euclidean configuration), we find branch-cut singularities whenever an operator crosses the lightcone of another. The way we deal with branch-cuts depends on the $i \epsilon$ prescription we adopted to reach this ordering of the Wightman function. In particular, as we move from fully spacelike separated points to the Regge kinematics we have $\{x_{14}^2, x_{23}^2,x_{25}^2,x_{35}^2\}\to \{|x_{14}^2|, |x_{23}^2|,|x_{25}^2|,|x_{35}^2|\}\times \exp(\pi i)$ which implies that the cross-ratios $u_2, u_4$ and $u_5$ go around 0 with the first going anticlockwise and the last two in clockwise direction. At the branch-cuts, OPEs $\phi_1\times \phi_2$ and $\phi_3\times \phi_4$, in which we block decompose our correlation function, are no longer convergent. We should then worry about boundedness in Regge limit. For a four-point function in the Regge limit and with operator ordering consistent with time ordering one can prove its boundedness. The general proof uses Rindler positivity~\cite{Casini:2010bf,Caron-Huot:2017vep, Maldacena:2015waa,Kologlu:2019bco} and bounds the latter Wightman function with another correlator of different ordering where the OPE does converge.
This proof does not work however with five-point functions. Nonetheless, we expect to be possible to find these type of bounds between different ordered Wightman functions or different channel decompositions but we will not make these considerations any more precise here.
Conformal Regge theory, on the other hand, provides a method to resum divergent OPEs and exhibit the dominant Reggeon-exchange contributions. This resumation invokes an analytic continuation of OPE data in spin for which, in the case of four-point functions, the justification follows from the Lorentzian inversion formula~\cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep,Simmons-Duffin:2017nub}. For higher-point functions, there are additional representation labels associated with the possible three-point structures between spinning operators.
%Here in particular we have $\ell$ and we must comment its role in this resumation procedure below.

In what follows we focus on double Reggeon-exchanges but similar analysis can be performed at the level of the single Reggeon exchanges, that we briefly discuss in Appendix~\ref{sec:otherregge}. The proper $i\epsilon$ prescription for these  cases follows straightforwardly from the corresponding kinematics since we want to consider the operator orderings consistent with time ordering.

The similarities of Mellin and flat space scattering amplitudes make the former a suitable tool  to build intuition. The goal of this section is to analyze the
Regge limit for Mellin amplitudes \cite{Costa:2012cb}.
We shall see that  the Regge limit for five operators, as defined in the previous section, is dominated by the same kinematics of flat space scattering amplitudes reviewed in
section \ref{sec:FlatSpaceScattering}.
In the following, we will review the definition of Mellin amplitudes, some of its properties and then analyze the Regge limit  in this language.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Definition and properties}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The definition of a Mellin amplitude, $\mathcal{M}(\delta_{ij})$,   is given by
\begin{align}
  \langle \mathcal{O}(x_1)\dots \mathcal{O}(x_n) \rangle  = \int [d\delta_{ij}] \,\mathcal{M}(\delta_{ij})\,\prod_{1\leq i <j \leq n} \frac{\Gamma(\delta_{ij})}{(x_{ij}^2)^{\delta_{ij}}}\,,
  \label{eq:scalarMellinamplitude}
\end{align}
where we decided to extract a  standard prefactor containing $\Gamma$ functions and  the integration variables $\delta_{ij}$ run parallel to the imaginary axis.
Since the Mellin variables are restricted by the condition $\sum_{j}\delta_{ij}=0$, with   $\delta_{ii}=-\Delta_i $,
%\begin{align}	
%\sum_{j}\delta_{ij}=0\,,  \qquad\qquad\delta_{ii}=-\Delta_i \,,
%\end{align}
we shall use the following set of independent Mellin variables
\begin{align}
  t_{12} & = 2\Delta_{\phi}-2\delta_{12}\,,
         & t_{34}                           & = 2\Delta_{\phi}-2\delta_{34}\,,
  \\
  s_{13} & = \Delta_{\phi} +2\delta_{13}\,,
         & s_{25}                           & =-2\delta_{25}\,,
  \qquad\qquad\qquad
  s_{45} = -2\delta_{45}\,,
  \nonumber
\end{align}
which is the same number as conformal cross ratios - see figure~\ref{fig:ReggeKineScatt}.
%  {\bf JVB: This figure was not being called in the text. I put it here but see if there's other place that you find better.}
One advantage of Mellin amplitudes is that it is easy to analytically continue from the Euclidean configuration to Lorentzian, as the space-time dependence is simple \cite{Mack:2009mi}.  For example, the configuration
of figure \ref{fig:ReggeLimitVsOthers} can be obtained just by adding a phase to the integrand \cite{Costa:2012cb}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:MellinAmpDefinition}
  % & \left(\frac{x_{12}^2x_{34}^2x_{15}x_{35}}{x_{13}}\right)^{\Delta_{\phi}}\langle \mathcal{O}(x_1)\dots \mathcal{O}(x_n) \rangle^{\circlearrowleft}  
  G^{\circlearrowleft} (u_i) = & \int [dt_{ij}ds_{ij}] \,u_4^{\frac{s_{45}}{2}} u_1^{\frac{t_{12}}{2}} u_3^{\frac{t_{34}}{2}} u_2^{\frac{s_{13}+s_{45}-t_{12}}{2} } u_5^{\frac{t_{34}-s_{25}-t_{12}}{2}} \mathcal{M}(s_{ij},t_{ij})
  \,e^{ -i\pi\frac{2 \left(s_{13}+s_{25}+s_{45}\right)+\Delta_{\phi} }{2}   }\nonumber                                                                                                                                                                          \\
                               & \Gamma \!\left(-\frac{s_{25}}{2}\right) \Gamma \!\left(-\frac{s_{45}}{2}\right) \Gamma \!\left(\frac{s_{13}+s_{25}+s_{45}}{2} \right) \Gamma \!\left(\frac{s_{13}-\Delta_\phi }{2}  \right)                                    \\
                               & \Gamma \!\left(\frac{t_{12}-s_{13}-s_{45}}{2} \right) \Gamma \!\left(\frac{t_{34}-s_{13}-s_{25}}{2} \right) \Gamma \!\left( \frac{2\Delta_\phi-t_{12}}{2}\right) \Gamma \!\left(\frac{2\Delta_\phi-t_{34}}{2}\right) \nonumber \\
                               & \Gamma \!\left(\frac{\Delta_\phi +s_{25}+t_{12}-t_{34}}{2} \right) \Gamma \!\left(\frac{\Delta_\phi +s_{45}-t_{12}+t_{34}}{2} \right) 
  \nonumber
  %= A^{\circlearrowleft} (u_i) .
\end{align}
where $G^{\circlearrowleft} $ is the correlator analytically continued to the Regge kinematics. 
This particular phase seems to make the integrand divergent for large imaginary values of $s_{ij}$. However, the $\Gamma$ functions in the definition of the Mellin amplitude cancel this apparent divergence.  To see this in more detail we just have to use the identity
\begin{align}
   & \Gamma\left(a+i\frac{x_i}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(b-i\frac{x_i}{2}\right) \approx 2\pi e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}(a-b)} \left(\frac{x_i}
  {2}\right)^{a+b-1}e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}x_i} \,,
\end{align}
in a regime where $s_{13}$ goes faster to infinity than $s_{45}$ and $s_{25}$. In the Regge limit, as defined in section \ref{sec:Regge_limit}, we have that the cross ratios  %{\bf{V:Check}} 
$u_2\rightarrow 1+\sigma_1\sigma_2 \xi_3$,  $u_4 \rightarrow 1-\sigma_2\xi_2$, $u_5 \rightarrow 1-\sigma_1\xi_1 $, with $u_1=\sigma_1^2,u_3=\sigma_2^2$ going to zero while $\xi_i$ are left fixed.  This simplifies the dependence of the Mellin amplitude on the cross ratios
\begin{align}
  u_4^{\frac{s_{45}}{2}} u_1^{\frac{t_{12}}{2}} u_3^{\frac{t_{34}}{2}} u_2^{\frac{s_{13}+s_{45}-t_{12}}{2} } u_5^{\frac{t_{34}-s_{25}-t_{12}}{2}} \rightarrow u_1^{\frac{t_{12}}{2}}  u_3^{\frac{t_{34}}{2}} e^{\frac{i(y_{25}\sigma_1\xi_1+y_{45}\sigma_2\cosh \xi_2-y_{13}\sigma_1\sigma_2\xi_3)}{2}}\,,
\end{align}
where we made the change $s_{ij} = iy_{ij}$. Note that the exponent is not small provided $\sigma_{i}$ and $y_{ij}$ scale appropriately.
By putting every piece together we obtain that in the Regge limit
\begin{align}
   & G^{\circlearrowleft}(u_i) = \pi^4\int [dt_{ij}] \,\Gamma \!\left(\frac{2\Delta_{\phi}-t_{12}}{2}\right)\Gamma \!\left(\frac{2\Delta_{\phi}-t_{34}}{2}\right)\frac{\sigma_1^{t_{12}}  \sigma_2^{t_{34}}  }{2^{\frac{t_{12}+t_{34}+\Delta_{\phi}-16 }{2}} e^{\frac{i\pi (\Delta_{\phi} +3t_{12}-t_{34})}{4}}  } \label{eq:ReggeMellinLimit1} \\
   & \int [dy_{ij}] \, y_{13}^{\frac{t_{12}+t_{34}-4-\Delta_{\phi} }{2}}y_{25}^{\frac{t_{12}+\Delta_{\phi}-t_{34}-2}{2}}y_{45}^{\frac{t_{34}+\Delta_{\phi}-t_{12}-2}{2}}e^{\frac{i(y_{25}\sigma_1\xi_1+y_{45}\sigma_2\cosh \xi_2-y_{13}\sigma_1\sigma_2\xi_3)}{2}} \mathcal{M}(t_{ij},y_{ij})\,,
  \nonumber
\end{align}
where we have defined
$u_1=\sigma_1^2$, $u_3=\sigma_2^2$
and we should take the leading behavior in $\mathcal{M}(t_{ij},y_{ij})$ when $y_{ij} \rightarrow \infty$ with $y_{13}/y_{25}y_{25}$ fixed. Thus, in the remaining part of the section we shall  analyze the Mellin amplitude in this limit. Let us just remark that the region of integration that dominates in the Regge limit is the same as for flat space scattering amplitudes.  %This is a direct consequence of the phase that was introduced after doing analytic continuation.  

One of the reasons to use Mellin amplitudes is their simple analytic structure. They are meromorphic functions of the Mellin variables $\delta_{ij}$ with just simple poles. This property follows, in a loose sense, from the structure of the OPE \cite{Goncalves:2014rfa}.  The exchange of primary operator with dimension $\Delta$ and spin $J$ (and its conformal family) implies that the Mellin amplitude has a infinite set of poles whose residues are given by a dynamical part (related to OPE data) and a kinematical one, {\em{i.e.}} determined by symmetry
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}(\delta_{ij}) \approx  \mathcal{M}_{\Delta} \equiv  \frac{R_{m}(\delta_{ij})}{\delta_{LR}-(\Delta-J+2m)} \,,\,
  \qquad\qquad  m=0,1,\,\dots\,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \delta_{LR} = \sum_{a=1}^{k}\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}\delta_{ai}\,,
  \label{eq:factorizationformula}
\end{align}
$m$ labels subleading twists and $R_m$ is related with lower-point Mellin amplitudes whose precise form has been studied in \cite{Goncalves:2014rfa}. This property is analogous to the factorization in flat space scattering amplitudes.

The residue itself, depending on the number of points, can have poles. To see this,  take as an example the Mellin amplitude of a five-point correlator and look, without loss of generality, to poles in $\delta_{12}$ (this corresponds to setting $k=2$ and $n=5$ in (\ref{eq:factorizationformula})). The residue $R_m(\delta_{ij})$, as mentioned before, depends on a kinematical part and on the four-point Mellin amplitude $\mathcal{M}_{{\cal O}345}$, where ${\cal O}$ is the operator being exchanged. A four-point Mellin amplitude can also have poles for the very same argument.

In this language, the exchange of operators of dimension $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ in the channels $(12)$ and $(34)$ is  respectively encoded  by the presence of poles in the Mellin amplitude
$\mathcal{M}_{5}(s_{ij},t_{ij})$ at $t_{12}=(\Delta_1-J_1+2m_1)$ and $t_{34} =  (\Delta_2-J_2+2m_2)$,
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{5}(s_{ij},t_{ij}) \approx \sum_{m_i}\frac{Q_{m_1,m_2}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})}{\big(t_{12}-(\tau_1+2m_1)\big)\big(t_{34}-(\tau_2+2m_2)\big)}+\dots\,,
  \label{eq:MellinamplitudepolesQ}
\end{align}
where the $\dots$ represent regular terms (or poles at other locations). Notice that the poles with $m_1=m_2=0$ are associated with the position space lightcone blocks \ref{eq:lightconeblocksspins} and $m_i>0$ correspond to corrections around the lightcone. The residue for these sequential poles is related to three-point functions involving the operators that are exchanged.


Now it remains to analyze the large $s_{ij}$ limit of the Mellin amplitude $\mathcal{M}(t_{ij},s_{ij})$.
As for the four-point case, the Casimir differential equations can be translated into Mellin space, where it transforms to a recurrence relation
that we defer to (\ref{eq:recurrencerelationsMellinCasi}) in appendix \ref{app:Blocks}.
%In particular the equation for the residue $Q_{m_1,m_2}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})$ is of the following form
%\begin{align}
%	\big[\mathcal{D}_{\textrm{5 pt,0}}^{(12) }+\mathcal{D}_3 \big] Q_{s_{25},s_{45},s_{13},m_1,m_2} + \mathcal{D}_2 Q_{s_{25},s_{45},s_{13},m_1-1,m_2} +\mathcal{D}_4 Q_{s_{25},s_{45},s_{13},m_1-1,m_2-1} =0
%	,
%\end{align}
%where the $(12)$ difference operators are given by expressions in \cref{app:mellinDiff}.
%The expressions for these operators are long but some of their properties are easy to state.
For the $m_i=0$ sector,  the difference equation simplifies considerably. Moreover, for each pair of spins $(J_1,J_2)$, there are $1+\textrm{min}(J_1,J_2)$ polynomial solutions which can be labeled by an integer $n$
and have the leading large $s_{ij}$ behaviour
%(\textbf{JVB: Put $\ell$ in the first position to be consistent with next equations?})
\begin{align}
  Q_{m_1,m_2}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13}) = c_{\ell,m_1,m_2}s_{25}^{J_1-\ell} s_{45}^{J_2-\ell}s_{13}^{\ell} +\dots \,,
  \label{eq:equationleadingsijMellin}
\end{align}
where $\dots$ represent lower degree terms in the Regge limit.
Note that the $\ell$ denotes a different basis of tensor structure compared to the position space.
%  One can think of this as yet another basis. 
 We have Mellin transformed the lightcone blocks (\ref{eq:lightconeblocksspins}) and verified the behavior  (\ref{eq:equationleadingsijMellin}).
  % {\bf since we know they are not the same basis shouldn't we say it clearly?}
%This is done in the appendix \ref{}.

%The solutions are polynomials of degree $J_1$ and $J_2$ in $s_{25}$ and $s_{45}$ respectively. The difference equation, for $m_i>0$ does not increase the degree of the polynomial.
The recurrence relation (\ref{eq:recurrencerelationsMellinCasi}) can be used to derive relations between $c_{\ell,m_1,m_2}$ with different values of $m_i$
\begin{align}
   & 2 m_1 c_{\ell ,m_1,m_2} \big(d-2 (J_1+m_1+\tau _1)\big)-c_{\ell ,m_1-1,m_2} \left(\Delta _{\phi }+2 J_2-2 m_{12}-\tau _{12}-2 \ell \right)    \nonumber                       \\
   & \times\left(2 m_1+\tau _1-2 \Delta _{\phi }\right)+c_{\ell ,m_1-1,m_2-1} \left(2 m_1+\tau _1-2 \Delta _{\phi }\right) \left(2 m_2+\tau _2-2 \Delta _{\phi }\right)=0\,,
  \label{eq:RecurrencerelationMellin}
\end{align}
for the $(12)$ channel where $m_{ij}=m_i-m_j$. This particular limit is important in the Regge kinematics.
% ({\bf{need to double check}})
It gives  two recurrence relations for the coefficients $c_{\ell,m_1,m_2}$ that allow  to fix them all in terms of the seed $c_{\ell,0,0}$. As mentioned before, the label $m_i$ in the poles are related to corrections around the lightcone blocks.  Fortunately, we have worked out all these corrections for scalar operators in position space in (\ref{eq:blockscalarposallmi})  and it is a simple exercise to translate the result into Mellin space, written in (\ref{eq:ScalarblockMellin}). In particular, this solution is consistent with (\ref{eq:RecurrencerelationMellin}).

%In particular, we can check this explicit solution solves the recurrence relation above.

It is possible to construct another solution to the scalar Casimir equation, written in Mellin space, by studying conformal partial waves (or alternatively, exchanged Witten diagrams using the split representation \cite{Costa:2014kfa}). The idea behind this approach is simple, however the computation involves several steps and for this reason is given in the appendix \ref{app:ScaMellinpar}.
%Let us point out that these objects are important per se and, in fact, will play a crucial role in the conformal Regge theory for five points.

Obviously, the Mellin amplitude of the scalar conformal partial wave only depends on the variables $t_{12}$ and $t_{34}$ and it is symmetric under $\nu\rightarrow -\nu$. More importantly,  it gives a solution valid at finite $t_{ij}$ and reduces to the solution (\ref{eq:ScalarblockMellin}) when $t_{ij}$ are at the poles. This leads us to study the casimir equation away from the poles.
%.  In particular, this formula reduces to  shed some light on a solution of the Casimir equation, in the Regge limit, also for finite $t_{ij}$. 
For this purpose let us write the Mellin amplitude as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ReggeizePartialWaveMellinSpace}
  \mathcal{M}_{J_1,J_2}(s_{ij},t_{ij}) = s_{25}^{J_1-\ell}s_{45}^{J_2-\ell}s_{13}^{\ell}\, f(t_{12},t_{34})\,,
\end{align}
and plug it in the the recurrence relation (\ref{eq:recurrencerelationsMellinCasi}).  In turn, this leads difference equation for $t_{12}$ and $t_{34}$ that reads
\begin{align}
   & f_{00} \left(t_{12}-\tau _1\right) \left(d-t_{12}-\tau _1-2J_1\right)+f_{-20} \left(2 \Delta_\phi -t_{12}\right) \left(t_{34}-t_{12}+\Delta_\phi +2 J_2-2 \ell \right)\nonumber \\
   & +f_{-2-2} \left(2 \Delta_\phi -t_{12}\right) \left(2 \Delta_\phi -t_{34}\right)=0\,,
\end{align}
%which is obtained from (\ref{}) by taking the leading term in the limit $s_{ij}\rightarrow \infty$ with the ratio $s_{13}/( s_{25}s_{45})$ fixed and
where the subindices denote $f_{a_1a_2} \equiv f(t_{12}+a_1,t_{34}+a_{2})$. This difference equation can be further simplified by redefining $f(t_{12},t_{34})$
\begin{align}
  \tilde{f}_{00} \left(\tau_1-t_{12}\right) \left(d-2 J_1-\tau_1-t_{12}\right)+2 \tilde{f}_{-20} \left(t_{12}-t_{34}-\Delta_{\phi}-2 J_2+2 \ell \right)-4 \tilde{f}_{-2-2}=0
\end{align}
where $\tilde{f}$ is given by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:HfunctionMellin}
  f(t_{12},t_{34}) =\frac{\tilde{f}(t_{12},t_{34})}{\Gamma(\frac{2\Delta_{\phi}-t_{12}}{2})\Gamma(\frac{2\Delta_{\phi}-t_{34}}{2})} .
\end{align}
Note that this prefactor is precisely the same as the one that comes from the Gamma functions in the definition of Mellin amplitudes (\ref{eq:scalarMellinamplitude}).
It is now simple to see that the equation for $J_1=J_2$ and generic $\ell$ can be obtained from the scalar difference equation by doing the following shifts
\begin{align}
  \Delta_{\phi}\rightarrow \Delta_{\phi}+2(J_1-\ell)	,\ \ \ \ d\rightarrow d-2J_1 .
\end{align}
This suggests that the Mellin partial wave for equal spin $J_1=J_2$ and generic $\ell$ can be obtained from (\ref{eq:scalarpartialMellin}) by doing these replacements. One way to check this statement is to build solutions with  the recursion relations in spin derived in \cite{Poland:2021xjs} (we have rederived parts of these relations in the appendix \ref{app:Blocks} using lightcone blocks) and verify that it agrees with the solution that we proposed above.% To do so we have expressed the recursion relations of \cite{Poland:2021xjs} in Mellin space and constructed solutions of the conformal partial wave from the scalar exchange. The details of this computations are relegated to appendix \ref{app:Blocks}.  {\color{blue} \bf Add appendix . This can also be used to: generate other solutions; find the change of basis between Mellin $n$ and the traditional  $\ell$. }


These solutions for Mellin amplitudes can then be inserted in (\ref{eq:ReggeMellinLimit1}) to obtain the conformal block in the Regge limit, that is
\begin{align}
   & G_{J_1,J_2,\ell,\nu_1,\nu_2}^{\circlearrowleft} (\sigma_i,\rho_i)=  \sigma_{1}^{1-J_1} \sigma_{2}^{1-J_2} \bar{\mathcal{H}}_{\nu_1\nu_2} (\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)  \,,
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
   & \bar{\mathcal{H}}_{\nu_1\nu_2} (\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)=\int dt_{12}dt_{34}\, \Gamma\! \left(\frac{2\Delta_{\phi}-t_{12}}{2}\right)\Gamma\! \left(\frac{2\Delta_{\phi}-t_{34}}{2}\right)\Gamma\! \left(\frac{2 \ell -\Delta_{ \phi} +t_{12}+t_{34}-2}{2} \right)\nonumber \\
   & \qquad\qquad\qquad
  \Gamma\!\left(\frac{2 J_1-2 \ell +\Delta_{ \phi} +t_{12}-t_{34}}{2} \right) \Gamma \!\left(\frac{2 J_2-2 \ell +\Delta_{ \phi}-t_{12}+t_{34}}{2} \right)\mathcal{M}_{\nu_1,\nu_2}(t_{12},t_{34})  \nonumber                                                                         \\
   & \qquad\qquad\qquad
  \xi_1 ^{\frac{t_{34}-t_{12}-\Delta_\phi -2 J_1+2 \ell }{2} } \xi_2 ^{\frac{t_{12}-t_{34}-\Delta_\phi -2 J_2+2 \ell }{2} }\xi_3 ^{\frac{2-t_{12}-t_{34}+\Delta_\phi -2 \ell }{2}}\,,
  \label{eq:HReggeLimitMellin}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{M}_{\nu_1,\nu_2}(t_{12},t_{34})$ is the conformal partial wave in Mellin space in the Regge limit. This expression highlights two properties of the Regge limit, firstly the limit is dominated by operators of
high spin and, secondly, it depends on three fixed cross ratios that can be thought of as angles, which is similar to  what happens in the Euclidean OPE limit as we mentioned before. In fact $\bar{\mathcal{H}}_{\nu_1\nu_2} $ solves the Casimir differential equation in the Euclidean region (\ref{eq:AngulardifferentialEquation}) but with a different eigenvalue $C$.  Let us point out that the integral (\ref{eq:HReggeLimitMellin}) can be done by picking up poles.

It follows from what was said above that  $\bar{\mathcal{H}}_{\nu_1\nu_2} (\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)$ must have the same form as (\ref{eq:factorizePolynomial}), as it solves the same conformal Casimir equation.
%Equation (\ref{eq:ellDiffequation}) can be used to obtain information about the dependence in $n$ (we comment on this issue in the appendix ({\bf{\color{blue} explicit examples}})).




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Comment on position space}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The analysis of the Regge limit in Mellin space of the previous section exposed the similarities to flat space scattering amplitudes but it does not emphasize enough the role of analytic continuation in the cross ratios in changing the behavior of the conformal block. This aspect is clearer in  position space, in particular, in the lightcone expressions introduced in subsection \ref{sec:lightcone}. The kinematics of the Regge limit (where some pair of points are timelike while others are spacelike) can be reached from the
Euclidean configuration after doing analytic continuations in $u_2,u_4$ and $u_5$ around $0$ as explained in section \ref{sec:EucToLorent}.

The analysis is simpler for the discontinuities around  $u_4, u_5=0$ in the lightcone blocks (\ref{eq:lightconeblocksspins}) and contains most of the physics we want to highlight in this subsection. These discontinuities come from the first two terms in the denominator of (\ref{eq:lightconeblocksspins}),  provided that $u_2> 0$.
The origin of branch point at, say $u_5=0$, comes from the region $t_1 \approx 1/(1-u_5)$ where the denominator $(1-(1-u_5)t_1)$ changes sign. To deal with this it is convenient to divide the integration region in two parts, 
% {\bf JVB: I suppose the $\pi$ in the exponent of (-1) should not be there}
\begin{align}
  \int_{0}^{1} dt_1 \,\mathcal{I}\ \rightarrow \   \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{1-u_5}} dt_1 \,\mathcal{I}+(-1)^{(h_1-\tau_2-2\ell+\Delta_\phi )} \int_{\frac{1}{1-u_5}} ^{1} dt_1\,\mathcal{I}\,,
\end{align}
where the phase comes from the change of sign in the factor $(1-(1-u_5)t_1)$. The first term drops out when taking the discontinuity and so we obtain
\begin{align}
  \textrm{Disc}_{u_5=0} \int_{0}^{1} dt_1\, \mathcal{I}= \big( 1-(-1)^{(h_1-\tau_2-2\ell+\Delta_\phi )} \big) \frac{u_5}{u_5-1}\int_{0}^{1} d\tau_1 \,\mathcal{I}\,,
\end{align}
where we have changed variables to $t_1 = (u_5\tau_1 -1)/(u_5-1)$ in order to have the integration running from $0$ to $1$ again.
It is possible to repeat the same steps to take the discontinuity of $u_4$.

Recall that the cross ratios $u_4$, $u_5$ and $u_2$ approach $1$ with $\tfrac{(1-u_2)}{(1-u_4)(1-u_5)}=\tfrac{1 + \zeta}{2}$ fixed in the Regge limit.
The discontinuity in $u_4$ and $u_5$  of the lightcone block after  the Regge limit is given by
\begin{align}
  \lim_{\substack{   u_4,u_5\rightarrow 1 \\   \zeta \, \textrm{fixed}}}\textrm{Disc}_{u_5,u_4=0} \mathcal{G}
  =\frac{u_1^{\frac{1-J_1}{2}}u_3^{\frac{1-J_2}{2}  }
  (1+\zeta)^{\ell} }{\xi_2^{\Delta_2-1}\xi_1^{\Delta_1-1} 2^{\ell} }\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}
  \frac{	\dbinom{\frac{\Delta_{\phi}-\tau_1-\tau_2-2J_1-2J_2}{2}}{m}
    \left( -\frac{1+\zeta}{2} \right)^{m}
    F_1 F_2
  }{
    \Gamma\!\left(\frac{2J_1+\Delta_{\phi}-2\ell+\tau_{12}}{2}\right) \Gamma\!\left(\frac{2J_2+\Delta_{\phi}-2\ell+\tau_{21}}{2}\right)
  }\,,
  \label{eq:discInu4u5}
\end{align}
where we have used $\tau_{ij}=\tau_i-\tau_j$, the cross ratios (\ref{eq:anglesdef}) and  %({\bf \color{blue} V:change cross ratios})
\begin{align}
  %\label{eq:Fdefinition}
  F_i & =
  \frac{
    \pi
    \Gamma^2(\frac{\tau_i+2J_i}{2})\, \Gamma(\tau_i+2J_i)\,\Gamma(\tau_i+2J_i+m-1)}{
    2^{J_i-\frac{1}{2}}
    \Gamma\!\left(\frac{\tau_1+\tau_2+2J_i+2m+2\ell-\Delta_{\phi}}{2}\right)
  }
  \, \pFq{2}{1}{ \ell-J_i,\tau_{i+1}+2J_{i+1}+m-1}{\tfrac{2J_{i+1}+2m+2\ell+\tau_1+\tau_2-\Delta_{\phi}}{2}}{\frac{\zeta+1}{2} }.\nonumber
\end{align}
The discontinuities in $u_4$ and $u_5$ are enough to reveal that the discontinuities of conformal block behave with $\sigma_1^{1-J_1}\sigma_2^{1-J_2}$ in the Regge limit, which compares with $\sigma_1^{\Delta_1}\sigma_2^{\Delta_2}$ of the Euclidean block\footnote{We also need to consider the monodromy of the lightcone block around the branch point at $u_2=0$.  It is possible to do  a Mellin transform of the lightcone block and apply the method of the previous subsection to derive all discontinuities. In the appendix, we provide several checks that the discontinuity of the block in $u_2$ has the same behavior. }.
It can also be shown from the previous formula that three sequential discontinuities,  $\textrm{Disc}_{u_2,u_4,u_5}$, evaluate to zero.
Recall that four-point conformal blocks have vanishing double discontinuity.
We believe that conformal blocks have this property away from the lightcone limit.

\subsection{Conformal Regge theory for five points}
\label{subsec:SWtransform}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us consider the representation of the five-point correlation function in terms of  conformal partial waves, and its implications for the Regge limit.
This basis  is complete and orthogonal.
Since we have more control over the analytic properties of the  partial waves in Mellin space, we consider the  expansion
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}(s_{ij},t_{ij} )= \sum_{J_1,J_2=0}^{\infty} \sum_{\ell=0}^{\textrm{min} \left( J_1, J_2 \right)}\int \frac{d \nu_1}{2\pi i}\,\frac{d \nu_2}{2\pi i}\, b_{J_1,J_2,\ell}(\nu_1,\nu_2)
  \mathcal{M}_{J_1,J_2,\ell}(s_{ij},t_{ij})
  \,.
  \label{eq:partialWave}
\end{align}
We suppress the dependence of the Mellin partial wave $ \mathcal{M}_{J_1,J_2,\ell} $ on the scaling dimensions, as the nontrivial analytic continuation occurs in other quantum numbers.
We have introduced  poles in the variables $ \nu_1$ and  $\nu_2 $ with residues corresponding to the OPE coefficients, using
\begin{align}
  b_{J_1,J_2,\ell}\left( \nu_1,\nu_2 \right) & \approx
  \frac{
    P_{\nu_1,\nu_2,J_1,J_2}^{\ell}
  }{
    \big( \nu_1^2- \left( \Delta_1 - h \right)^2 \big) \big( \nu_2^2- \left( \Delta_2 - h \right)^2 \big)
  }\,,
  \label{eq:residueValue}
\end{align}
where $\Delta_i=\Delta_i(J_i)$ is the dimension of the $i$-th exchanged operator of spin $J_i$.
% This is related to the conformal block expansion by a contour deformation in $ \nu_1,\nu_2 $ and using (\ref{eq:conformalpartialwave}).
We remark that  the product of the OPE coefficients   $P_{\nu_1,\nu_2,J_1,J_2}^{\ell}$ in (\ref{eq:residueValue}) is a linear combination
of those in (\ref{eq:OPE_coeffs}) that appear in the conformal block expansion. 

% {\bf JVB: Figure 12 left is wrong. In principle, there are other poles to the left of the contour coming from the sine functions (the same is true for the $\ell$ complex-plane but I think it is ok as it is). One cannot move the red contour to the left that much without encounter the pole at $\ell-1$ for instance. They are there even if for some reason they don't contribute. The easiest resolution is to center the frame close to $\ell$ similarly to what is drawn on the right or on figure 7. Btw, we should also remove one arrow from each axis.}

We would like to provide a Sommerfeld-Watson representation of (\ref{eq:partialWave}).
First, we swap the range of summations as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}(s_{ij},t_{ij} )
  = \sum_{\ell=0}^{ \infty}
  \sum_{J_1,J_2=\ell}^{\infty}
  \int \frac{d \nu_1}{2\pi i}\,\frac{d \nu_2}{2\pi i}\, b_{J_1,J_2,\ell}(\nu_1,\nu_2)
  \mathcal{M}_{J_1,J_2,\ell}(s_{ij},t_{ij})
  \,.
  \label{eq:partialWaveSwapped}
\end{align}
% Then, we analytically continue in $ \ell $ before dealing with the spins $ J_1,J_2 $.
% It is difficult to visualize all the contours in the complex $ J_1,J_2,\ell $ plane, as they form a three dimensional subspace of  a six real dimensional space.
% We represent in terms of individual complexified variables $ J_1, J_2, \ell $, as shown in figure \ref{fig:contourDeformationJ1J2}.
%Multiple figures 
Next, we   analytically continue in the spin quantum numbers.
However, the $ b_{J_1,J_2,\ell} $ are not expected to have a unique
analytic  continuation in   the quantum numbers. For that reason we need to consider
their    \textit{signatured} counterparts.

Let us remind the reader the analogous construction \cite{Costa:2012cb} for the four-point correlator $ \mathcal{A}( u,v ) $ in terms of the cross ratios
\begin{align}
  u =  \frac{x_{12}^2 x_{34}^2 }{x_{14}^2 x_{23}^2 } \,, \qquad v = \frac{x_{13}^2 x_{24}^2 }{x_{14}^2 x_{23}^2}\,.
\end{align}
% The function $ \mathcal{A}(u,v) $ has nontrivial monodromies in the complex $ v $ plane around $ v = 1 $ and $ v= \infty $.
% % Consider a swap of $ x_3 \leftrightarrow x_4 $, which maps $ v $ to $ 1/u$ and $ u $ to $ u/v $.
% In this case, we split the amplitude in terms of \textit{signatured} amplitudes \footnote{Consider $ \mathcal{A}(z) = \log z $ as a toy model. It has a branch point at $ z=0 $ with monodromy $ 2\pi i $. However, $ \log (1/z) $ also has branch point at $ z=0 $ but with monodromy $ -2\pi i $. Therefore, one can define $ \mathcal{A}_{+} = \log z  + \log (1/z)$ which has trivial monodromy around $ z=0 $.  }, $\mathcal{A}_{\theta = \pm}$, such that $ \mathcal{A} (u,v) = \mathcal{A}_{+} + \mathcal{A}_{-} $.
% These are related by the following relation
% \begin{align}
% 	\mathcal{A}_{\theta}( u,v ) =
% 	\frac{1}{2}
% 	\left[
% 		\mathcal{A}( u,v )
% 		+ \theta
% 		\mathcal{A}\!\left( \frac{u}{v},\frac{1}{v}\right)
% 		\right] .
% 	\label{eq:signaturedAmpFourPoints}
% \end{align}
% They are designed to have cuts in the complex $ v $ plane such that $ \mathcal{A}_{+} $ has a nontrivial discontinuity in $ t $ channel, i.e., around $ v = 1 $, and $ \mathcal{A}_{-} $ has a nontrivial discontinuity in $ u $ channel, i.e., around $ v = \infty $.
After expanding in Euclidean partial waves, we can write the correlation function as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{A}( u,v)
  =
  \displaystyle\sum_{J=0}^{\infty}
  \displaystyle\int_{\frac{d}{2}+i \mathbb{R}}
  \frac{d\Delta}{2\pi i}\,
  c_{\Delta,J}\,
  F_{\Delta,J} ( u,v )
  \,,
  \label{eq:EuclideanInversion}
\end{align}
where $ c_{\Delta,J} $ denotes the OPE function and $ F_{\Delta,J} $ is the Euclidean partial wave.
It can be transformed to Mellin space as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}(s,t)
  =
  % \frac{1}{2\pi i}
  \displaystyle\sum_{J=0}^{\infty}
  \int_{\frac{d}{2}+i \mathbb{R}}
  \frac{d\Delta}{2\pi i}\,
  c_{\Delta,J}\,
  \mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J} (s,t)
  \,.
  \label{eq:MellinInversion}
\end{align}
% The signatured partial wave is defined according to \cref{eq:signaturedAmpFourPoints}, whereas the signatured OPE function is the component of the signatured correlator on the partial wave.
Again, the OPE function $ c_{\Delta,J} $ is not uniquely defined in the complex $ J $ plane.
Thus, we define the signatured OPE function $ c_{\Delta,J}^{\theta} $ by
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{\theta} (s,t)
  =
  \displaystyle\sum_{J=0}^{\infty}
  \displaystyle\int_{\frac{d}{2}+i \mathbb{R}}
  \frac{d\Delta}{2\pi i}\,
  c_{\Delta,J}^{\theta}\,
  \mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J}^{\theta} (s,t)
  \,,
  \label{eq:signaturedMellin}
\end{align}
where the signatured Mellin partial waves are given by
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J}^{\theta} (s,t)
  =
  \frac{1}{2}
  \big[
    \mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J} (s,t)
    + \theta
    \mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J}(-s,t)
    \big]
  \,,
  \label{eq:signaturedMellinAmp4pt}
\end{align}
with $\theta=\pm$.
The signatured Mellin amplitude allows for a unique analytic continuation of the
signatured OPE function $ c_{\Delta,J}^{\theta} $ \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}.
The problem of the non-signatured OPE function can be traced back  the factor of $(-1)^J$ that appears
in the transformation $s\to-s$,
%$\mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J}(-s,t) = (-1)^J  \mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J}(s,t)$
which follows
%  can be hinted 
from the large $s$
behaviour $\mathcal{M}_{\Delta,J}(s,t) \approx s^J$.

A similar construction can be done for five-point functions.
We split the full correlator into eight parts depending on the \emph{signature} denoted by $ \mathbb{\theta} = (\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_{12}) $ where each component can be $\pm$.
% They are dual to the quantum numbers $ J_1,J_2,\ell $, respectively.
We define the  \textit{signatured} amplitudes as
\begin{align}
   & \mathcal{M}_{\theta}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})
  %  \nonumber \\ 
  %  & 
  =
  \frac{1}{8}
  \big[
    \mathcal{M}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})
    +
    \theta_1
    \mathcal{M}(-s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})
    +
    \theta_{2}
    \mathcal{M}(s_{25},-s_{45},s_{13})
  \nonumber                                     \\
   &
    +
    \theta_1 \theta_{2}
    \mathcal{M}(-s_{25},-s_{45},s_{13})
    +
    \theta_{12}
    \mathcal{M}(-s_{25},-s_{45},-s_{13})
    +
    \theta_1 \theta_{12}
    \mathcal{M}(s_{25},-s_{45},-s_{13})
    \nonumber
  \\
   &
    +
    \theta_{12} \theta_{2}
    \mathcal{M}(-s_{25},s_{45},-s_{13})
    +
    \theta_1 \theta_{12} \theta_{2}
    \mathcal{M}(s_{25},s_{45},-s_{13})
    \big]
  \,.
  \label{eq:signaturedMellinAmp}
\end{align}
This equation is suitable only for $s_{ij} \gg 1$.
We also suppress the dependence on $ t_{ij} $ for brevity.
We justify it by using the properties of the Mellin partial wave (\ref{eq:ReggeizePartialWaveMellinSpace})  which,
in terms of $ J_i'=J_i-\ell $,  behaves in the  Regge limit as
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{J_1',J_2',\ell}(s_{ij},t_{ij}) & = s_{25}^{J_1'}s_{45}^{J_2'} \, s_{13}^{\ell}\, f(t_{12},t_{34})\,.
  % \mathcal{M}^{\theta}_{J_1,J_2,\ell} &= s_{25}^{J_1'} s_{45}^{J_2'} s_{13}^{\ell_\phantom{1}}
\end{align}
By analogy with the four-point case, we expect that OPE functions associated with the expansion of the signatured amplitudes in
(\ref{eq:signaturedMellinAmp}) have a unique analytic continuation in all quantum numbers $J_1',J_2',\ell$.
It would be interesting to put this on a firm footing by deriving dispersion relations along the lines of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}.
The full Mellin amplitude can then be written in terms of the signatured Mellin amplitude as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:fullMellinFromSignature}
  \mathcal{M}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13} ) & = \sum_{\theta \in \{ -1,1 \}^{3}} \mathcal{M}_{\theta} (s_{25},s_{45},s_{13} )
  \,.
\end{align}

% We would like to perform the integral over the $ \ell $ contour by splitting the odd and even values.
% This is analogous to the case of five point S matrix, wherein the quantum number $ m $ was split into positive and negative values.
% Defining $ J_i' = J_i-\ell $ and signatured partial wave as $ \mathcal{M}_{J_1',J_2',\ell}^{\theta}(u_i) $, we write
In terms of the signatured analogue of partial waves defined through (\ref{eq:signaturedMellinAmp}), we write
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{\theta} ( s_{ij},t_{ij} )=
  \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{J_1',J_2'=0}^{\infty}
  \int \frac{d \nu_1}{2\pi i}\,
  \frac{d \nu_2}{2\pi i}\, b_{J_1',J_2',\ell}^{\theta}(\nu_1,\nu_2) \mathcal{M}_{J_1',J_2',\ell}^{\theta}(s_{ij}, t_{ij})
  \,.
  \label{eq:partialWaveSwappedOddEven}
\end{align}
Next we  perform a Sommerfeld-Watson transform on the $ \ell $ contour.
% Since we have more control over the analytic properties of the Euclidean partial waves, we perform these calculations in Mellin space.
% As discussed before, in the Regge limit the Mellin amplitude of the partial wave is given by (\ref{eq:ReggeizePartialWaveMellinSpace}).
% Note that the leading power of the polynomial depends only on $ J_1'$ and $J_2' $.
% Thus, the Mellin amplitude of the signatured correlator $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} $ denoted by $ \mathcal{M}_{\theta} ( s_{ij},t_{ij}) $, is given by
% Signatured Mellin amplitudes are defined as
% \begin{align}
% 	\label{eq:signaturedMellinAmp}
% 	 & \mathcal{M}_{\theta}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})
% 	%  \nonumber \\ 
% 	%  & 
% 	=
% 	\frac{1}{8} 
% 	\big[
% 		\mathcal{M}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})
% 		+
% 		\theta_1
% 		\mathcal{M}(-s_{25},s_{45},s_{13})
% 		+
% 		\theta_{2}
% 		\mathcal{M}(s_{25},-s_{45},s_{13})
% 	\nonumber                                     \\
% 	 &
% 		+
% 		\theta_1 \theta_{2}
% 		\mathcal{M}(-s_{25},-s_{45},s_{13})
% 		+
% 		\theta_{12}
% 		\mathcal{M}(-s_{25},-s_{45},-s_{13})
% 		+
% 		\theta_1 \theta_{12}
% 		\mathcal{M}(s_{25},-s_{45},-s_{13})
% 		\nonumber
% 	\\
% 	 &
% 		+
% 		\theta_{12} \theta_{2}
% 		\mathcal{M}(-s_{25},s_{45},-s_{13})
% 		+
% 		\theta_1 \theta_{12} \theta_{2}
% 		\mathcal{M}(s_{25},s_{45},-s_{13})
% 		\big]
% 	\,.
% \end{align}
% This equation is suitable only for high energies as we are using $ u_{ij} \approx -s_{ij} $ upto finite terms.
% We have also suppressed the dependence on $ t_{ij} $ for brevity.
% 
% We provide a heuristic justification for the above definition. 
% 
% First, we note that each of the variables $ s_{25},s_{45},s_{13} $ has a series of poles on the real axis on both right half plane and left half plane, as can be seen from (\ref{eq:MellinAmpDefinition}).
% We choose a definition for a signature triplet $ \theta $ and corrrespond it to the series of poles on the real axis, positive or negative depending on the $ \theta_i=1 $ or $ -1 $.
% For instance, $ \theta=(1,1,1) $ corresponds to the series of poles on the positive real axis in each of $ s_{13}, s_{25}, s_{45} $.
% Then, we require that the other series of poles have zero residue.
% It uniquely fixes the signatured Mellin amplitude \cref{eq:signaturedMellinAmp}, upto an arbitrary constant which we choose to be $ 1/8 $, such that,
% The full Mellin amplitude can be written in terms of the signatured Mellin amplitude as
% \begin{align}
% 	\mathcal{M}(s_{25},s_{45},s_{13} ) & = \sum_{\theta \in \{ -1,1 \}^{3}} \mathcal{M}_{\theta} (s_{25},s_{45},s_{13} )
% 	\,.
% \end{align}
First, we replace the summation over $ \ell $ by an integral over the blue contour shown in figure \ref{fig:contourDeformationJ1J2}.
Then we  move the contour around the non-negative integers to a vertical contour $ \mathbf{V} $ located at $ -1/2+i \mathbb{R} $, as shown in figure \ref{fig:contourDeformationJ1J2}.
We assume that we do not encounter any poles during this procedure.
This assumption is inspired by an analogous procedure for the five particle S-matrix.
Indeed the quantum number $ \ell $ labels a choice of tensor basis for three-point functions and therefore should not
have a dynamic content, just like the
helicity quantum number for the S-matrix  \cite{Abarbanel:1972ayr}.
Thus after deforming the $\ell$ contour we have
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{\theta} ( s_{ij},t_{ij}) & =
  \int_{\mathbf{V}} \frac{d \ell}{2\pi i} \frac{1}{\sin ( \pi \ell)}
  \sum_{J_1',J_2'=0}^{\infty}
  \int \frac{d \nu_1}{2\pi i}\,
  \frac{d \nu_2}{2\pi i}\, b_{J_1',J_2',\ell}^{\theta}(\nu_1,\nu_2)\mathcal{M}_{J_1',J_2',\ell}^{\theta}(s_{ij},t_{ij})
  \,.
\end{align}

Next we analytically continue in $ J_1'$ and $J_2' $.
The analytic structure in these variables is analogous to the case of four-point correlation functions.
Figure \ref{fig:contourDeformationJ1J2} shows the analytic structure of the integrand in (\ref{eq:partialWaveSwappedOddEven}).
In particular there is a leading Regge pole in the $ J_i $ plane at $ J_i =j_i( \nu_i ) $ given by
\begin{align}
  \left[ \Delta_i\big(j_i( \nu_i )\big)- h \right]^{2}  -\nu_i^{2}  = 0\,.
\end{align}
% The leading behaviour of the function $ \mathcal{M} $ is derived in (\ref{eq:ReggeizePartialWaveMellinSpace}), namely
% \begin{align}
% 	\label{eq:ReggeizePartialWaveMellinSpaceRepeat}
% 	\mathcal{M}_{J_1,J_2,\ell}(s_{ij},t_{ij})&= s_{25}^{J_1}s_{45}^{J_2} \, \eta^{\ell}\, f(t_{12},t_{34})\,.
% \end{align}
% We remind the reader that $ \eta = s_{13}/(s_{25} s_{45}) $ and $ f $ is defined in (\ref{eq:HfunctionMellin}).
Picking the poles in the complex spin planes at $J_1'= j_1(\nu_1)-\ell$ and $J_2'= j_2(\nu_2)-\ell$,  we obtain
the following expression for the signatured correlators
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}_{\theta}
  =
  \int
  \frac{d \nu_1}{2\pi i}\,
  \frac{d \nu_2}{2\pi i}
  \, s_{25}^{j_1( \nu_1)} s_{45}^{j_2( \nu_2)}
  \int_{\mathbf{V}} \frac{d \ell}{2\pi i}\,
  \,
  \frac{
    b_{j_1(\nu_1),j_2(\nu_2),\ell}^{\theta}(\nu_1,\nu_2) \,
    f_{\nu_1,\nu_2,\ell}^{\theta}(t_{ij})\, \eta^{\ell}
  }{\sin(\pi \ell) \sin\!\big(\pi (j_1(\nu_1)-\ell)\big) \sin\!\big(\pi (j_2(\nu_2)-\ell)   \big)}
  \,,\label{eq:pickingJ1J2poles}
\end{align}
where $ f_{\nu_1,\nu_2,\ell}^{\theta} $ is defined as the signatured analogue of $ f $ in (\ref{eq:HfunctionMellin}).
Thus, in the Regge limit the full correlator has the form
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{M}
  =
  \int
  \frac{d \nu_1}{2\pi i}\,
  \frac{d \nu_2}{2\pi i}
  \, s_{25}^{j_1\left( \nu_1 \right)} s_{45}^{j_2\left( \nu_2 \right)}
  \int_{\mathbf{V}} \frac{d \ell}{2\pi i}\, \eta^{\ell}  g_{\nu_1,\nu_2,\ell}(t_{ij})
  \,,\label{eq:final}
\end{align}
where the function $g_{\nu_1,\nu_2,\ell} (t_{ij})$ is defined from replacing (\ref{eq:pickingJ1J2poles}) in (\ref{eq:fullMellinFromSignature}).
This allows us to represent the Reggeized Mellin amplitude in terms of the operator content of the leading Regge trajectories and their couplings to the external states.

%As for the four point function  \cite{Costa:2017twz}, we expect that the $\nu$ integrals can be done by saddle point, leading to the behavior $\mathcal{M} \sim s_{25}^{j_1^*} s_{45}^{j_2^*} F(t_{ij})$, where $j_i^*$

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have discussed the generalization of the Regge limit to higher-point correlation functions in conformal field theories in general dimensions.
For the case of five-point functions, we defined the five-variable generalization of the Mack polynomials, and discussed its properties.
Using the leading order behavior of these polynomials, we studied the multi-Regge limit of the correlator which is dominated by the leading Regge trajectories.
% We also argued that there are no additional singularities in the complexified quantum numbers apart from the poles associated with the complexified spin.

By considering the implications of multi-Regge limit in Mellin space, we arrived at a proposal for the kinematics of the multi-Regge limit in  position space.
We studied the behavior of the conformal block in this limit, using the recent results on lightcone blocks for higher-point functions.
To compute the monodromies of the conformal block, we also used some techniques from the study of hypergeometric functions. 

Mellin space is a good place to study the multi-Regge limit of the correlators.
We expect that the multi-Regge limit for conformal field theories in Mellin space is analogous to that of the flat space S matrix in Mandelstam space.
The generalization of the partial wave expansion in the S matrix is done in \cite{White:1976qm}, for four dimensional quantum field theories.
Analogous generalization of the partial wave expansion is within reach for three dimensional CFTs for $n$-point functions.
We would benefit from the fact that there are no representations of the rotation subgroup of the conformal group in three dimensions with more than one rows in the Young's tableaux.
However, for higher dimensions, there will be proliferation of indices labelling the internal vertices.


In the process, we also discussed a novel basis of three-point functions of operators with spin $\left(  J_1,J_2,0  \right)$, respectively.
This basis is useful for study of Euclidean OPE limit as it leads to the analytic expression for the conformal block in this limit.
These expressions appear to be a natural generalization of the Wigner $ d $ function used in the S matrix.
This suggests that the basis used in the literature for three-point functions of operators with spin $\left(  J_1,J_2,J_3  \right)$ might not be the most natural one for the study of Euclidean conformal blocks.
Given the importance of conformal blocks in numerical bootstrap, it would be interesting to study the properties of this basis in more detail.
The case of $\left(  J_1,J_2,J_3  \right)$ three-point function is accessible in the Euclidean OPE limit of six-point function in the snowflake channel.

The new basis appears to be useful to arrive at a Euclidean inversion formula for the five-point functions, mainly due to simple orthogonality properties.
While the study of analytic structure of the correlator of higher-point functions is still in its infancy, we expect that it admits a drastic simplification in the multi-Regge limit.
It would be interesting to derive an inversion formula and dispersion relation in the multi-Regge limit for CFTs, along the lines of \cite{NotesOnMultiRegge}.
An important ingredient is the multivariable generalization of the Cauchy formula, called the Bargman-Weil formula.

Finally, in the S matrix case, a crucial ingredient for the absence of singularities in $ \ell $ was the use of Steinmann relations.
% We have assumed that the Steinmann relations hold for the CFTs.
It would be interesting to explore the analogue of Steinmann relations in CFTs.
%Since these relations follow from basic properties of any quantum field theory, it is likely that they hold for CFTs as well. In particular, they might further constrain  holographic supergravity amplitudes for more than four point functions. See \cite{Caron-Huot:2016owq} for analogous progress in the weakly coupled $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ super Yang-Mills.
